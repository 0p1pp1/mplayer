MPlayer DVD-kit v2.2 :)
made by Pontscho & A'rpi for the MPlayer project

What the hell is this?
======================
nothing special, just collection of sources and patches and fixes:

- dvdread 0.9.3 + static libdvdcss (removed dlopen code)
- libdvdcss 1.2.2 + per-disc css key cache patch
- optimizations enabled, asserts disabled
everything packed together with _static_ linking to maximize performance

Why?
====
users keep complaining about the still not fixed assert() bug, the
buggy libdvdcss 1.0 or the slow key-cracking process...
so Pontscho decided to pack these together, fix bugs and make it
available for the MPlayer users.

Hey, I don't like this, this is not legal!
==========================================
It is GPL code, so should be legal, anyway if you don't want it, just
delete this directory! MPlayer's ./configure will check if this directory
exists, so it is OK to delete.

How to compile mpdvdkit as shared library (lib*.so)?
=====================================================
After running MPlayer's ./configure, change this line in config.mak:
DVDKIT_SHARED = no
to:
DVDKIT_SHARED = yes
and make; make install; ldconfig
