MPlayer DVD-kit v2.2 :)
made by Pontscho & A'rpi for the MPlayer project

What the hell is this?
======================
Nothing special, just a collection of sources and patches and fixes:

- dvdread 0.9.3 + static libdvdcss (removed dlopen code)
- libdvdcss 1.2.2 + per-disc css key cache patch
- optimizations enabled, asserts disabled
everything packed together with _static_ linking to maximize performance.

Why?
====
Users keep complaining about the still not fixed assert() bug, the
buggy libdvdcss 1.0 or the slow key-cracking process...
So Pontscho decided to pack these together, fix bugs and make it
available for the MPlayer users.

Hey, I don't like this, this is not legal!
==========================================
It is GPL code, so it should be legal, anyway if you don't want it, just
delete this directory! MPlayer's ./configure will check if this directory
exists, so it is OK to delete it.

How to compile mpdvdkit as a shared library (lib*.so)?
======================================================
After running MPlayer's ./configure, change this line in config.mak:
DVDKIT_SHARED = no
to:
DVDKIT_SHARED = yes
and make; make install; ldconfig
