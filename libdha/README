lidbha - Direct Hardware Access library
=======================================

This library was designed for providing direct hardware access under different
OS'es and architectures, so it's platform- and os-independent.

The main project on tthe top of libdha is Vidix. It provides userspace
video drivers (Matrox, Ati, 3Dlabs, Trident).

For the full list of supported OS'es read the sources, but here's a reported
as working list (these platforms are used daily):
 Linux/x86
 FreeBSD/x86
 NetBSD/x86
 Linux/PPC

There are different ways to access the hardware, normally only ROOT can do that.
With root privileges libdha will finely run, but there are some others ways
to use it as a normal user:
1, set the SUID bit on the binary (in this was it runs with root priviliges)
2, use svgalib kernel helper
3, use dhahelper (not yet finished)

The library is based on XFree86 and gfxdump (a utility from GATOS project)
sources.

Original import and design by Nick Kurshev and Alex Beregszaszi.
Current maintenance and dhahelper by Alex Beregszaszi.
Svgalib kernelhelper support by Matan Ziv-Av.
