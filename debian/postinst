# postinst script for mplayer

set -e

# summary of how this script can be called:
#        * <postinst> `configure' <most-recently-configured-version>
#        * <old-postinst> `abort-upgrade' <new version>
#        * <conflictor's-postinst> `abort-remove' `in-favour' <package>
#          <new-version>
#        * <deconfigured's-postinst> `abort-deconfigure' `in-favour'
#          <failed-install-package> <version> `removing'
#          <conflicting-package> <version>
# for details, see /usr/share/doc/packaging-manual/
#
# quoting from the policy:
#     Any necessary prompting should almost always be confined to the
#     post-installation script, and should be protected with a conditional
#     so that unnecessary prompting doesn't happen if a package's
#     installation fails and the `postinst' is called with `abort-upgrade',
#     `abort-remove' or `abort-deconfigure'.

## MPlayer config file
##
## This file can be copied to /etc/mplayer.conf and/or ~/.mplayer/config .
## If both exist, the ~/.mplayer/config's settings override the
## /etc/mplayer.conf ones. And, of course command line overrides all.
## The options are the same as in the command line, but they can be specified
## more flexibly here. See below.
##

vo=$RET			# To specify your default video output see -vo help for
			# valid settings

fs=yes			# Enlarges movie window to your desktop's size.
			# Used by drivers: all

vm=no			# Tries to change to a different videomode
			# Used by drivers: dga2, x11, sdl

#bpp=0			# Force changing display depth.
			# Valid settings are: 0, 15, 16, 24, 32
			# may need 'vm=yes' too.
			# Used by drivers: fbdev, dga2, svga

zoom=no			# Enable software scaling (powerful CPU needed)
			# Used by drivers: svga

# x=800			# scale movie to <x> pixels width
# y=600			# scale movie to <y> pixels height
