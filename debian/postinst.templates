Template: mplayer/overwrite
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Overwrite /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf ?
 Should I overwrite your current /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf with the one created on the fly based on your answers?

Template: mplayer/cfgnote
Type: note
Description: Create your ~/.mplayer/conf file.
	Remember to read documentation and edit your ~/.mplayer/conf
	(or /etc/mplayer/mplayer.conf) file. This binary depends heavily on
	your hardware - which means that it needs tweaking for every single
	machine it's installed to. And it also it means that it will use
	your setup very effectively. Look at /usr/share/doc/mplayer
