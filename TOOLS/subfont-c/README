Usage:
~~~~~~
1. Make sure you have FreeType 2 installed.
2. Get a TrueType or Type 1 font.
3. Modify `runme' script for your encoding and font path.
4. Type: ./runme
5. Copy *.raw and font.desc files to ~/.mplayer/font/
6. Run subfont alone to see more options.


About:
~~~~~~
`subfont' program renders antialiased OSD and subtitle fonts for mplayer.

What you get are bitmap and alpha *.raw files and a font.desc.
What you need is TrueType, Type 1 or any other font supported by FreeType.

Alpha channel is created using outline and Gaussian blur filters.

ANY encoding is now supported! That is, all 8-bit encodings known by libc
and user-supplied encodings (also multibyte) through custom encoding files.

I prepared also Type 1 font `osd.pfb' for OSD characters based on bitmaps
created by chass.

Subfont was tested with Korean fonts from truetype-fonts-ko-2.0-1k.noarch.rpm
I found on http://rpmfind.net/ and euc-kr encoding.  Custom encoding file
for euc-kr was generated from charmap I found in /usr/share/i18n/charmaps/EUC-KR.gz
(glibc package).  This should work with -unicode switch for mplayer
(though it is not Unicode encoding).
It took about 14 seconds to render over 8000 characters on P3 @ 600MHz.


Custom encodings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For each character you want to render write the line consisting of:
 hexadecimal Unicode character code,
 followed by whitespace,
 followed by hexadecimal number representing your encoding,
 followed by new line character.

Example: to render a single letter `aogonek' (Unicode 0x0105) and encode
it using iso-8859-2 encoding (0xB1), your custom encoding file will consist
of a sigle line:
0105 B1


Notes:
~~~~~~
  + Starting x position of each character and the bitmap width is aligned
to multiple of 8 (required by mplayer).

  + Currently subfont won't work on big-endian systems.

  + My development platform is RedHat 7.1.  FreeType versions tested are
2.0.1 through 2.0.4.

  + FreeType library has a bug that makes subfont display some warning message
about Unicode charmap for osd.pfb.
