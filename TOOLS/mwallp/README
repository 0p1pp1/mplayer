mwallp - mplayer's wallpaper setting utility
======

Usage: mwallp file1.jpg [file2.jpg file3.jpg ...]

About:
~~~~~~
MWallp is a simple tool to set .jpg images as background/wallpaper on the
desktop. It scales (bicubic) and convert the given jpg image to desktop
size/bpp and set as background of Root window.

If more than 1 filenames given, it randomly selects one, so running something
like 'mwallp ~/.wallpapers/*.jpg' from cron will randomly changes wallpaper.

Why?
~~~~
I've tried several programs, and as most of them used Imlib, their quality
sucks (Imlib uses neares-neighbour scaling...).
So I've decided to put together something very simple but efficient built
using the MPlayer codebase.
