Preamble
========

             BEGINNERS MUST NOT TRY USING THESE SCRIPTS!!!

Installation
============
 - READ AND _U N D E R S T A N D_ WHAT THE SCRIPTS DO!
 - Copy the four shell scripts into an empty dir
 - Copy main.tar.gz to the same place (CVS checkout, compressed)
 - Copy ffmpeg.tar.gz to the same place (CVS checkout, compressed)
 - Create samples/ dir
 - Create samples to be used for benchmarking
 - (OPTIONAL) Create SAMPLE_FILE_NAME.opts file, containing
   standard MPlayer options - for usage with ONLY that file.
   Like:  samples/MPEG1			MPEG1 file
	  samples/MPEG1.opts		"-vc mpeg12"
	  samples/MPEG1_ffmpeg12	same MPEG1 file as MPEG1
	  samples/MPEG1_ffmpeg12.opts	"-vc ffmpeg12"
   etc...
 - 'touch xmga' if you have Matrox, and want to test mga_vid too
   (RTFS for these "touch" features)
 - if doing Xv and/or xmga tests, start an X server, and exec xhost +localhost
 - Push ./start
 - WAIT
 - (recover from backup;)))
 - See $BUILDDIR/log-2002-08-30 (today's date..) for the output.

Fuck. (TODO?;)
