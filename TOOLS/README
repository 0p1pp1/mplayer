README for the TOOLS directory
==============================

Preamble
--------

In this directory you can find some nice scripts and code that makes
using MPlayer and MEncoder easier, for example scripts for DVD track
encoding in three pass mode or creating SVCDs from a movie.

FIXME: Document all the stuff in the subdirectories.



MPlayer scripts in the TOOLS dir

Usage:        mpconsole [mplayer options]


mplmult.sh

Author:       Reimar Döffinger

              the video arbitrarily.

Usage:        mplmult.sh <n> <options>
              n        number of MPlayer instances that display the video
              options  any options you would pass to MPlayer, more than
                       one file will usually not work


subsearch.sh

Author:       Alex Beregszaszi

Description:  Collects subtitle files from the directory given as argument

menc2pass

Author:       Felix Bünemann

Description:  Helper script to ease MEncoder two pass encoding. Give it all
              the encoding parameters you would pass to mencoder, but leave

dvd2divxscript.pl

Author:       Florian Schilhabel

Description:  Yet another DVD to divx helper script.
              This script encodes a DVD track in three pass mode to MPEG-4 with
              libavcodec. Optionally it writes the resulting movie file to
              CD-ROM the corresponding audio track to MP3. It can also shut
              down the computer when it finishes. If you like, you can
              watch the MEncoder output on /dev/tty8.

Usage:        --help       show help
              --abr        (AudioBitRate) Please enter the desired bitrate this
                           can be either [96|128|192] kbit/sec (default: 128).
              --lang       Specify the Language of the audio track this can be
                           for example <en> or <de> (default: <de>).
              --dvd        Specify the DVD track you want to encode.
              --cdsize     Specify the size of your CD-ROM (default: 700MB).
              --shutdown   Shutdown the system, when the encoding process has
                           finished. Needs appropriate privileges.
              --out        Specify the name of your encoded movie. The file
                           extension will be appended automatically.
              --writecd    Takes the newly created movie and writes it to a
                           CD-ROM.
              --writedev   cdrecord device identifier, for example 0,1,0
              --speed      writing speed (default: 4)
              --dvd-device device to pull the video off (default: /dev/dvd)


aconvert

Author:       Jonas Jermann

Description:  A hack to allow MEncoder to read respectively encode from audio
              only files.

Usage:        aconvert <"input file"> <"output file"> <"options">
              If no options are specified the following is assumed:
              -oac lavc -lavcopts acodec=mp3:abitrate=192

Note:         The script is probably bash dependent and it's just a quick
              hack, feel free to improve it (or much better: fix mencoder ;).



qepdvcd.sh

Author:       Reynaldo H. Verdejo Pinochet

Description:  anything supported to VCD/SVCD PAL/NTSC converter

Usage:        qepdvcd.sh file <options>
              Run with no arguments to see the list of options.

Note:         You will need vcdimager/cdrecord to master/burn the resulting
              files.


Tech scripts in the TOOLS dir
-----------------------------

fastmem.sh

Author:       Arpi

Description:  benchmark/testbed for fastmemcpy stuff

Usage:        fastmem.sh


sws-test

Author:       Michael Niedermayer

Description:  Very simple script to generate PNG images from a video with all
              -sws methods.

Usage:        sws-test <video-file> <start-pos> <res>

              example: sws-test abc.avi 10 160:120


calcbpp.pl

Author:       Moritz Bunkus

Description:  A script that calculates the $bpp for a movie, mentioned in
              DOCS/tech/encoding-tips.txt, see that document for more info.

Usage:        calcbpp.pl <resolution> <aspect ratio> <bitrate> <fps>
              resolution:    the cropped but unscaled resolution
                             (use '-vf cropdetect')
              aspect ratio:  the encoded aspect ratio. All DVDs come at
                             720x576 but contain a flag that tells the player
                             wether it should display the DVD at an aspect
                             ratio of 4/3 (1.333) or at 16/9 (1.777). Have a
                             look at MPlayer's output - there's something
                             about 'prescaling'. That's what you are looking
                             for.
              bitrate:       the video bitrate in kbit/s
              fps:           the fps

              example: calcbpp.pl 720x440 16/9 896 25


countquant.pl

Author:       Moritz Bunkus

Description:  Counts the quantizers used for the encoding, mentioned in
              DOCS/tech/encoding-tips.txt, see that document for more info.

Usage:        countquant.pl < divx2pass.log
              It will print out which quantizer was used how often. If you see
              that e.g. the lowest quantizer (vqmin=2) gets used for > 95% of
              the frames then you can safely increase your picture size.


perlbench.pl

Description:  fastmemcpy benchmark script

Usage:        perlbench.pl


plotpsnr.pl

Author:       Jonas Jermann

Description:  Draw PSNR log graphs using gnuplot.

Usage:        plotpsnr.pl [options] <file>
              -h, --help    Display this help message
              -quant        Display quantizers
              -size         Display size
              -psnr         Display PSNR
              -iframes      Display I-frames
              -pframes      Display P-frames
              -bframes      Display B-frames
              -aframes      Display all frames in different colors
              -cmp <file2>  Compare two files
              -qs <style>   Quantizer style
              -ss <style>   Size style
              -ps <style>   PSNR style

              Default: -quant -size -psnr -qs "p" -ss "i" -ps "p"

Note:         Requires gnuplot. Comparison is based on file2. Comparison
              assumes that the frame numbers of both files fit.


psnr-video.sh

Author:       Matthias Wieser

Description:  Calculates the PSNR between two existing video files.
              The PSNR is calculated frame by frame.
              Also prints the overall PSNR.
              The script can be used to:
               * Compare different softwarescalers (should I use
                 -sws 1 or -sws 2 ?)
               * Compare different resolutions (is it better to scale
                 down to 640x360 or to 560x320)
               * Compare different deinterlacers
               * Compare different video codecs
               * Compare video filters (is it better to use -vf hqdn3d
                 or lavcopts:nr=400)
               * [...]

Usage:        psnr-video.sh <file1> <file2> [<frames>] [<options1>] [<options2>]

              <file1> and <file2> are the video files for which the PSNR
                should be calculated.
              [<frames>] is the number of frames to process, starting
                from frame 1.
              [<options1>] are additional MPlayer options for <file1>
              [<options2>] are additional MPlayer options for <file2>

              A file called ./psnr.dat will be created with the following
              content:

              File;Y;Cb;Cr
              00000001.ppm;34.23;39.54;40.06;35.426
              00000002.ppm;33.03;38.71;39.26;34.271
              00000003.ppm;33.45;38.91;39.28;34.655
              00000004.ppm;32.72;38.69;38.85;33.972
              [...]
              00000247.ppm;35.55;40.84;42.15;36.785
              PSNR:;35.9887

Note:         This script relies on the the tool "pnmpsnr" for the
              frame-by-frame PSNR calculation.
              Be aware that psnr-video.sh needs a lot of temporary space
              inside /temp/.
