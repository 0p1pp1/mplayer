Known bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Special system/cpu-specific bugs/problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. SIGILL (signal 4) in draw_frame, on P3 (mostly with 2.2.x kernels):
  Problem: movups is crashing in libvo/fastmemcpy.h
  Workaround:  ./configure --disable-fastmemcpy

2. No image (black image) in RGB 16bpp (x11,dga,fbdev,svga) playing
  MPEG files on SMP machine:
  Problem: bug(?) in MMX YV12->RGB16 converter code
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-mmx

3. SIGILL or other fault at loading l3codeca.acm:
  Problem: shared libs are loaded to 0x00100000 instead of 0x40000000
  Workaround: mplayer -afm 1 ...

Please contact me if you experienced any of the above problems. We need
people to test fixes and send us as many system details information as
possible (kernel+libc+gcc+binutils version, test results, /proc/cpuinfo etc)
because these are system-dependent problems and aren't reproducable here.
Please tell me if you can fix them or you are only a user.
Unfortunately we can't reproduce these here, so it's very hard to fix.

Various A-V sync and other audio problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
General audio delay or jerky sound (exists with all or many files):
- bad select() in audio driver (including ALSA's OSS emulation)
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-select
- audio buffer problems
  Workaround:  mplayer -abs option
- slow machine (cpu or vga)
  try with -vo null, if it plays well, then you have slow VGA card/driver:
  Workaround: buy a faster card or read DOCS/VIDEOCARDS about how to speed up

Audio delay specific to one or a few files:
- bad file (pleae upload the file, so we can check & fix)
  Workaround: -ni and/or -bps options
              -delay option or +/- keys at runtime to adjuts delay
- your soundcard doesn't support 48Khz playback
  Workaround: buy a better soundcard...
- file has VBR mp3 audio
  Workaround: mplayer -mc 0

After many > or ^ (fast forward) audio vs. video is going out of sync (ASF/AVI)
- bug in mplayer code (a-v sync probs after seek... not really bug but
  my avi/asf seeking code is not perfect yet)

Signal 11 in decode_audio:
- mp3lib doesn't handle (yet) well bad/broken audio streams
  Workaround: -afm 4
- if it's still bad, try with -nosound  [and report the bug, see BUGREPORTS]

No sound at all:
- your file uses an unsupported codec
  Workaround: read DOCS/CODECS, and help us adding support for it

Video-out problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First note: options -fs -vm and -zoom are just recommendations, not (yet)
supported by all drivers. So it isn't a bug if it doesn't work.
Only a few driver supports scaling/zooming, don't except this from x11 or dga.
