Known bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Special system/cpu-specific bugs/problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. SIGILL (signal 4) in draw_frame, on P3 (mostly with 2.2.x kernels):
  Problem: movups is crashing in libvo/fastmemcpy.h
  Workaround:  ./configure --disable-fastmemcpy
  SOLVED: disabled SSE code in fastmemcpy.h ;(

2. No image (black image) in RGB 16bpp (x11,dga,fbdev,svga) playing
  MPEG files on SMP machine:
  Problem: bug(?) in MMX YV12->RGB16 converter code
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-mmx
  SOLVED: bug of gcc-2.96  -  you should use 2.95.2 or 2.95.3

3. SIGILL (signal 4) or other fault at loading l3codeca.acm:
  Problem: shared libs are loaded to 0x00xxxxxx instead of 0x40xxxxxx
  Workaround: mplayer -afm 1 ...
  SOLVED: you are using some security kernel patch, like OpenWall etc.

4. General SIGILL (signal 4):
  Problem: you compiled and run mplayer in different machines
    (for example compiled on P3 and runinng on celeron)
  Solution: compile MPlayer on machine where you will use it
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-sse etc. options

Various A-V sync and other audio problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
General audio delay or jerky sound (exists with all or many files):
- bad select() in audio driver (including ALSA's OSS emulation)
  Workaround: ./configure --disable-select
  SOLVED: using ioctls instead of select in the new audio code
- audio buffer problems
  Workaround:  mplayer -abs option
  SOLVED: using ioctls in the new audio code
- slow machine (cpu or vga)
  try with -vo null, if it plays well, then you have slow VGA card/driver:
  Workaround: buy a faster card or read DOCS/VIDEOCARDS about how to speed up
  SOLVED: try -framedrop

Audio delay/de-sync specific to one or a few files:
- bad file (please upload the file, so we can check & fix)
  Workaround: -ni or -bps option   (for non-interlaved or bad files)
              -mc 0   (required for files with VBR audio)
              -delay option or +/- keys at runtime to adjust delay
- your soundcard doesn't support 48Khz playback
  Workaround: buy a better soundcard... 
              or try to decrease fps by 10% (use -fps 27 for a 30fps movie)

After many > or ^ (fast forward) audio vs. video is going out of sync (ASF/AVI)
- bug in mplayer code (a-v sync probs after seek... not really bug but
  my avi/asf seeking code is not perfect yet)
  Workaround: -bps

Signal 11 in decode_audio:
- mp3lib doesn't handle (yet) well bad/broken audio streams
  Workaround: -afm 4
  SOLVED: fixed mp3lib, it must be rock solid now!
- if it's still bad, try with -nosound  [and report the bug, see BUGREPORTS]

No sound at all:
- your file uses an unsupported codec
  Workaround: read DOCS/CODECS, and help us adding support for it

Video-out problems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First note: options -fs -vm and -zoom are just recommendations, not (yet)
supported by all drivers. So it isn't a bug if it doesn't work.
Only a few driver supports scaling/zooming, don't expect this from x11 or dga.
