* Can't change output encoding...it's always ISO-8859-1. :-(
  Should figure out a way to change it...
  
  <xsl:output encoding="..."/> does not seem to work with xsltproc.
  
  <xsl:param name="chunker.output.encoding" select="'...'"/> seems not to
  work either.
  
  Is it a limitation of xsltproc?
