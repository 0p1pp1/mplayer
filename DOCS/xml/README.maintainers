The documentation and its translations reside in subdirectories.
When building the documentation, the toplevel Makefile goes into
the subdirectories listed in the SUBDIRS variable and executes make
in each of those directories to create the HTML documentation
in subdirectories of the 'HTML' directory.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT place sensitive files under 'HTML'!
	   It is for generated documentation only.
	   The whole directory tree is wiped out by the Makefile
	   when running 'make distclean' or 'make clean-html'.
	   Also, subdirectories are wiped out one by one before
	   creating the HTML files.

Each subdirectory must have a Makefile.  Its purpose is to include
the toplevel Makefile.inc file (with the rules to build the docs)
and add dependency information to the main target, $(HTMLDIR)/index.html.
The main target usually depends on all the XML and XSL files in the
subdirectory.  (Note that the toplevel *.xsl files are added automatically
by Makefile.inc, so you do not have to list them.)


Adding new translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Create a new subdirectory and copy the XML files there.
2) Make sure to create a 'Makefile' for the translation -- you can
   use 'en/Makefile' as an example.
3) Set <book lang="XX"> to your language code if the DocBook XSL
   stylesheets support it.
4) If you want to use a customized XSL stylesheet, create one and name it
   'html.xsl'.  And do not forget to import the toplevel XSL file:

	<xsl:import href="../html.xsl"/>

5) If you are using your own HTML stylesheet, edit your Makefile and set
   the HTML_STYLESHEET variable to its name.
   
That's all, in theory.
