<title>GCC 2.96</title>

<formalpara>
<title>The background:</title>
<para>
The GCC <emphasis>2.95</emphasis> series is an official GNU release and
version 2.95.3 of GCC is the most bug-free in that series.  We have never
noticed compilation problems that we could trace to gcc-2.95.3. Starting
with Red Hat Linux 7.0, <emphasis>Red Hat</emphasis> included a heavily
patched CVS version of GCC in their distribution and named it
<emphasis>2.96</emphasis>. Red Hat included this version in the
distribution because GCC 3.0 was not finished at the time, and they needed
a compiler that worked well on all of their supported platforms, including
IA64 and s390. The Linux distributor <emphasis>Mandrake</emphasis> also
followed Red Hat's example and started shipping GCC 2.96 with their
Linux-Mandrake 8.0 series.
</para>

<formalpara>
<title>The statements:</title>
<para>
The GCC team disclaimed any link with GCC 2.96 and issued an
<ulink url="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.96.html">official response</ulink>
to GCC 2.96.  Many developers around the world began having problems with
GCC 2.96, and started recommending other compilers. Examples are
<ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-3.23.html">MySQL</ulink>,
<ulink url="http://avifile.sourceforge.net/news-old1.htm">avifile</ulink>
and
<ulink url="http://www.winehq.com/news/?view=92#RH 7.1 gcc fixes compiler bug">Wine</ulink>.
Other interesting links are

Linux kernel news flash about kernel 2.4.17</ulink>
and
<ulink url="http://www.voy.com/3516/572.html">Voy Forum</ulink>.
<application>MPlayer</application> also suffered from intermittent problems
that were all solved by switching to a different version of GCC. Several
projects started implementing workarounds for some of the 2.96 issues, but
we refused to fix other people's bugs, especially since some workarounds
may imply a performance penalty.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
You can read about the other side of the story
<ulink url="http://www.bero.org/gcc296.html">at this site</ulink>.
GCC 2.96 does not allow <literal>|</literal> (pipe) characters in assembler
comments because it supports Intel as well as AT&amp;T Syntax and the
<literal>|</literal> character is a symbol in the Intel variant. The
problem is that it <emphasis>silently</emphasis> ignores the whole
assembler block. This is supposedly fixed now, GCC prints a warning instead
of skipping the block.
</para>

<formalpara>
<title>The present:</title>
<para>
Red Hat says that GCC 2.96-85 and above is fixed. The situation has indeed
improved, yet we still see problem reports on our mailing lists that
disappear with a different compiler. In any case it does not matter any
longer. Hopefully a maturing GCC 3.x will solve the issue for good.  If you
want to compile with 2.96 give the <option>--disable-gcc-checking</option>
flag to <filename>configure</filename>. Remember that you are on your own
and <emphasis>do not report any bugs</emphasis>. If you do, you will only
get banned from our mailing list because we have had more than enough flame
wars over GCC 2.96. Please let the matter rest.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
If you have problems with GCC 2.96, you can get 2.96-85 packages from the
Red Hat <ulink url="ftp://updates.redhat.com">ftp server</ulink>, or just
go for the 3.0.4 packages offered for version 7.2 and later. You can also
get <ulink url="ftp://people.redhat.com/jakub/gcc/3.2-10/">gcc-3.2-10 packages</ulink>
(unofficial, but working fine)
and you can install them along the gcc-2.96 you already have. MPlayer will
detect it and use 3.2 instead of 2.96. If you do not want to or cannot use
the binary packages, here is how you can compile GCC 3.x from source:
</para>

<procedure>
<step><para>
  Go to the
  <ulink url="http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">GCC mirrors</ulink>
  page and download <filename>gcc-core-XXX.tar.gz</filename> where XXX is
  the version number.  This includes the complete C compiler and is sufficient for
  <application>MPlayer</application>. If you also want C++, Java or some of
  the other advanced GCC features <filename>gcc-XXX.tar.gz</filename> may
  better suit your needs.
  </para></step>
<step><para>
  Extract the archive with
  <screen>tar -xvzf gcc-core-XXX.tar.gz</screen>
  </para></step>
<step><para>
  GCC is not built inside the source directory itself like most programs,
  but needs a build directory outside the source directory.  Thus you need
  to create this directory via
  <screen>mkdir gcc-build</screen>
  </para></step>
<step><para>
  Then you can proceed to configure gcc in the build directory, but you
  need the configure from the source directory:
  <screen>
cd gcc-build
../gcc-3.XXX/configure</screen>
  </para></step>
<step><para>
  Compile GCC by issuing this command in the build directory:
  <screen>make bootstrap</screen>
  </para></step>
<step><para>
  Now you can install GCC (as root) by typing
  <screen>make install</screen>
  </para></step>
</procedure>

<sect1 id="mplayer-binary">
<title>Binary distribution</title>

<para>
<application>MPlayer</application> previously contained source from the
OpenDivX project, which disallows binary redistribution.This code has been
removed in version 0.90-pre1 and the remaining file <filename>divx_vbr.c</filename>
that is derived from OpenDivX sources has been put under the GPL by its authors
as of version 0.90pre9. You are now welcome to create binary packages as you
see fit.
</para>

<para>
Another impediment to binary redistribution was compiletime optimizations
for CPU architecture.  <application>MPlayer</application> now supports
runtime CPU detection (specify the
<option>--enable-runtime-cpudetection</option> option when compiling). It
is disabled by default because it implies a small speed sacrifice, but it is
now possible to create binaries that run on different members of the Intel
CPU family.

<sect1 id="nvidia-opinions">
<title>nVidia</title>

<para>
We dislike the fact that <ulink url="http://www.nvidia.com">nVidia</ulink>
only provides binary drivers (for use with XFree86), which are often buggy. 
We have had many reports on
<ulink url="http://mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/">mplayer-users</ulink>
about problems related to these closed-source drivers
and their poor quality, instability and poor user and expert support.
Here is an example from the
<ulink url="http://www.nvnews.net/forum/showthread.php?s=fda5725bc2151e29453b2da3bd5d2930&amp;threadid=14306">nVidia Linux Forum</ulink>.
Many of these problems/issues keep appearing repeatedly.
We have been contacted by nVidia lately, and they said these bugs do not
exist, instability is caused by bad AGP chips, and they received no reports
of driver bugs (like the purple line). So if you have a problem with your
nVidia card, you are advised to update the nVidia driver and/or buy a new
motherboard or ask nVidia to supply open-source drivers.  In any case, if
you are using the nVidia binary drivers and facing driver related problems,
please be aware that you will receive very little help from our side
because we have little power to help in this matter.

<title>Joe Barr</title>

<para>
Joe Barr became infamous by writing a less than favorable
<ulink url="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1214.mplayer.html">
<application>MPlayer</application> review</ulink>.
He found <application>MPlayer</application> hard to install, but then
again he is not very fond of
<ulink
url="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-06/lw-06-exam.html">reading documentation</ulink>.
He also concluded that the developers were unfriendly and the documentation
incomplete and insulting. You be the judge.
He went on to mention <application>MPlayer</application> negatively in his
<ulink url="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2001/1227.predictions.html">10 Linux predictions for 2002</ulink>.
In a followup
<ulink url="http://www.linuxworld.com/site-stories/2002/0125.xine.html">review of xine</ulink>
he continued stirring up controversy. Ironically at the end of that article
he quotes his exchange with Günter Bartsch, the original author of xine,
that perfectly summarizes the whole situation:

<blockquote><para>
However, he also went on to say that he was "surprised" by my column about
Mplayer and thought it was unfair, reminding me that it is a free software
project. "If you don't like it," Bartsch said, "you're free not to use it." 
</para></blockquote>
</para>

<para>
He does not reply to our mails. His editor does not reply to our mails.
Here are some quotes from different people about Joe Barr, so you can form
your own opinion:
</para>

<para>
Marc Rassbach has
<ulink url="http://daily.daemonnews.org/view_story.php3?story_id=2102">something to say</ulink>
about the man

<blockquote><para>
You may all remember the LinuxWorld 2000, when he claimed that Linus T said
that 'FreeBSD is just a handful of programmers'. Linus said NOTHING of the
sort. When Joe was called on this, his reaction was to call BSD supporters
assholes and jerks.
</para></blockquote>
</para>

<para>
A <ulink url="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/2001-December/009118.html">quote</ulink>
from Robert Munro on the
<ulink url="http://mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/">mplayer-users</ulink>
mailing list:

<blockquote>
<para>
He's interesting, but not good at avoiding, um... controversy.  Joe Barr
used to be one of the regulars on Will Zachmann's Canopus forum on
Compuserve, years ago.  He was an OS/2 advocate then (I was an OS/2 fan
too).
</para>

<para>
He used to go over-the-top, flaming people, and I suspect he had some hard
times, then. He's mellowed some, judging by his columns recently.
Moderately subtle humor was not his mode in those earlier days, not at all.
