Porting status:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file should tells you what architectures and or OSes MPlayer/MEncoder
are currently ported to.

We are always happy about ports to new archs/OSes or improvements to the
current ones, so if you can help us, read patches.txt and happy hacking! ;-)
Remember to also send a patch that updates this file if possible!

Of course we are also grateful about hardware/software donations that help
us to do porting or improvements of ports ourselves. (The MPlayer core
developers currently mainly own x86 hardware.)

If you would like to donate or have porting questions, feel free to contanct
the MPlayer developers via the mplayer-dev-eng mailing-list (more info on
www.mplayerhq.hu).

Here is a list of the architectures/OSes, MPlayer/MEncoder currently run on
and also some notes or the points that still need to be done or improved:
