If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets ...



Documentation:

 * a nice and complete MEncoder tutorial

 * continue docs review

 * check docs for completeness

 * write documentation HOWTO/rules document



Small improvements:

 * vo mga should completely blank the screen like fbdev and tdfxfb
   (maybe there should be an option - some people seem to like it the
   way it is, but then fbdev should also behave like this..)

 * Debian package creates mplayer.conf.1 .2 ...

 * -vo fbdev -fb device ---> -fbdev:device

 * accept dvd://9-12 command line

 * make -geometry work with all vo drivers

 * Make the output windows remember their positions when resizing to
   double size.

 * Ability to completely disable those popups ('cannot access cdrom',
   'your system is too slow...').

 * Ability to resize to full size/double size/triple (or half) size
   upon key presses.

 * wildcard support for MEncoder - mencoder *.avi blah



Cleanup:

 * integrate dvdnav into mplayer structure

 * integrate libmpdvdkit2 into mplayer structure (message system and
   command line options)

 * remove all obsolete code, options, files etc

 * move Zoran JPEG encoder to video filters

 * convert -zr options to -zr suboption:suboption format

 * Restructure configure and fix CPU flags supported but not shown.



Filters:

 * eq filter should support RGB in addition to YUV



Enhancements:

 * adapt colored output from MPlayerXP

 * merge VIDIX from MPlayerXP/sourceforge

 * port ASF muxing from MPlayerXP

 * write nut muxer/demuxer

 * SSA style & colors handling

 * plugin structure for vf/af

 * support for VirtualDub and Winamp plugins

 * implement xawtv config file parser (for channels, etc)

 * SYUV and paletted RGB support in swscaler

 * implement Plextor compatible SCSI VCD reading

 * udp:// support (like xine and vlc)

 * -stop option for MPlayer similar to -endpos for MEncoder

 * color subtitles

 * swf (flash) demuxer

 * DirectX video acceleration -vo for Windows (similar to XvmC)

 * hardware MPEG encoding support (Ati cards)



Difficult stuff:

 * reverse engineer all closed source codecs (QDM2, WMV9, Real, ...)

 * support for Bink/Smacker codecs

 * frame stepping

 * allow frame insertion & removal in video filters (with timestamps)

 * mixing of multiple videos (picture in picture, ...)

 * stay in pause after seek, fullscreen etc

 * write something like mptv to replace xawtv

 * write/adapt a C implementation of RTSP

 * real mmsu:// support

 * encode to OGM, MP4, ASF, nut

 * xinerama video filter that splits movie to 2 screens (like zr)

 * top notch DVD navigation like a hardware player

 * JACK support
