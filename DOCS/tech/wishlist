If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets ...



Documentation:

 * a nice and complete MEncoder tutorial

 * continue docs review

 * check docs for completeness

 * write documentation HOWTO/rules document



Small improvements:

 * vo mga should completely blank the screen like fbdev and tdfxfb
   (maybe there should be an option - some people seem to like it the
   way it is, but then fbdev should also behave like this..)

 * Debian package creates mplayer.conf.1 .2 ...

 * -vo fbdev -fb device ---> -vo fbdev:device

 * make -geometry work with all vo drivers

 * Make the output windows remember their positions when resizing to
   double size.

 * Ability to completely disable those popups ('cannot access cdrom',
   'your system is too slow...').

 * Ability to resize to full size/double size/triple (or half) size
   upon key presses.

 * wildcard support for MEncoder - mencoder *.avi blah

 * real mute support, not just setting volume 0



Cleanup:

 * integrate dvdnav into mplayer structure

 * integrate libmpdvdkit2 into mplayer structure (message system and
   command line options)

 * remove all obsolete code, options, files etc

 * move Zoran JPEG encoder to video filters

 * convert -zr options to -zr suboption:suboption format

 * Restructure configure and fix CPU flags supported but not shown.



Filters:

 * eq filter should support RGB in addition to YUV
