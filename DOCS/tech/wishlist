If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets ...


Documentation:

 * a nice and complete MEncoder tutorial

 * continue docs review

 * check docs for completeness

 * write documentation HOWTO/rules document

 * New german documentation maintainer ;)


Bug fixes:

 * fix mf ijpg encoding

 * fix crashing DLLs


Small improvements:

 * vo mga should completely blank the screen like fbdev and tdfxfb
   (maybe there should be an option - some people seem to like it the
   way it is, but then fbdev should also behave like this..)

 * Debian package creates mplayer.conf.1 .2 ...

 * -vo fbdev -fb device ---> -fbdev:device

 * accept -dvd 9-12 command line

 * specify suboptions in a config file without breaking playback (use
   channel 21 if using -tv, same idea for -vf, -af, etc...) 


Cleanup:

 * move -dump* options to mencoder

 * integrate dvdnav into mplayer structure

 * integrate libmpdvdkit2 into mplayer structure (message system and
   command line options)

 * remove all obsolete code, options, files etc

 * modularize all VOs, AOs, as well as audio/video codecs/filters like
   vidix drivers; it'd make the main binary smaller and packager's job
   easier

 * move zoran jpeg encoder to video filters

 * convert -zr options to -zr suboption:suboption format


Filters:

 * eq filter should support RGB in addition to YUV

 * drop-deinterlace plugin

 * hue, saturation sw eq filters

 * implement gamma correcture filter


Enhancements:

 * adapt colored output from MPlayerXP

 * merge VIDIX from MPlayerXP

 * SSA style & colors handling

 * plugin structure for vf/af

 * support for VirtualDub and Winamp plugins

 * implement xawtv config file parser (for channels, etc)

 * finish icc support

 * G400 2nd head through mga_vid ;)

 * dts support

 * do more things automagically

 * guess correct DVD title

 * syuv support in swscaler


Difficult stuff:

 * reverse engineer all closed codecs (SVQ3, QDM2, WMV8/9...)

 * stay in pause after seek, fullscreen etc

 * write something like mptv to replace xawtv

 * write a C implementation of rtsp (redundant)

 * real mmsu:// support

 * encode to mpg, ogm, mp4, asf

 * develop new video overlay interface (something like vidix but with
   less idiotic interface and more compatible with Xv for easier
   driver porting) 

 * scale playback speed

 * xinerama video filter that splits movie to 2 screens (like zr)

 * top notch DVD navigation like a hardware player
