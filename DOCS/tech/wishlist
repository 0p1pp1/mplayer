 * Make the output windows remember their positions when resizing to
   double size.

 * Ability to resize to full size/double size/triple (or half) size
   upon key presses.

Cleanup:

 * integrate dvdnav into mplayer structure

 * integrate libmpdvdkit2 into mplayer structure (message system and
   command line options)
