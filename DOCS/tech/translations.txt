HOW TO DO A GOOD TRANSLATION FOR MPLAYER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We always welcome new translations, but please be aware that
translations are not just one time jobs. They have to be maintained
in order to be useful. Otherwise they quickly get outdated and become
obsolete, useless cruft. That said, we would be happy if you could
maintain a new documentation translation.

Documentation related discussions happen on the MPlayer-DOCS mailing list.
If you want to maintain a translation you should subscribe there, as all
documentation CVS changelogs are also sent there, which you need to keep
the translation up to date. You can subscribe here:

http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-docs

Send updates and patches to this mailing list or directly to the documentation
or console message maintainers, see DOCS/tech/MAINTAINERS for details.

Translations of MPlayer documentation consist of 3 parts in descending
order of importance:

1) console messages (help/help_mp-XX.h)
2) man page
3) XML documentation

Please note that only doing 1) or 1) + 2) is perfectly fine.

You can find the latest versions of the help_mp-XX.h files in CVS or
here:

http://www.mplayerhq.hu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/main/help/

help_mp-en.h is the master file that you should use as a base for translations.
If you are adopting an already existing translation, please check it from top
to bottom once. Later it should suffice to just translate missing messages. If
you want to check for untranslated messages the help/help-diff.sh script comes
in handy:

  help_diff.sh help_mp-XX.h < help_mp-en.h

will print untranslated messages to the screen, just substitute XX with your
language code. Additionally, please make sure that your translated messages fit
on an 80 character wide display to avoid overflowing output.

Translations are for documentation what porting is for code. Many more eyes
see it and get to find mistakes. If you stumble over mistakes, inaccuracies,
clumsy wording, spelling/grammar errors or if you notice that something is
incomplete, please let us know, we'll fix it. Patches are more than welcome,
of course.
