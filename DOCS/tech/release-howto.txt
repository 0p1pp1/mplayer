how to make an mplayer release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

preparations:
- ask the DOCS maintainers to commit their final changes, check if
  all docs is uptodate etc
- verify manpage, remove obsolete options, mention new ones
- ask translation maintainers to update their help_mp*.h file
- update teh ChangeLog file (according to cvs log), ask other developers
  to verify their parts etc. ask Diego to spellcheck it.
- consult at -dev-eng about unstable codes which should be disabled for release

create the release tree:
- cvs checkout the mplayer src tree
- if releasing from 'main', checkout libavcodec from ffmpeg cvs
- remove teh CVS subdirs: 
    find 0_90 -name CVS -exec rm -rf {} \;
- remove the .cvsignore files:
    find 0_90 -name .cvsignore -exec rm {} \;
- remove obsolete DOCS translations, help files
- replace version.sh with this (change version number too...):
============
#!/bin/sh
echo "#define VERSION \"0.90rc5-$1 \"" >version.h
============

release the tree:
    cd ..
    mv main MPlayer-0.90rc5
    tar -cf MPlayer-0.90rc5.tar MPlayer-0.90rc5
    bzip2 -9 MPlayer-0.90rc5.tar

test it (download to your local machine, extract, compile, run)

copy to ftp:
    cp MPlayer-0.90rc5.tar.bz2 /home/ftp/MPlayer/releases/

move the older (pre)release(s) (except the last one before the current one)
to ../old-stuff/ dir

somehow get Gabu to write a news entry for the release, and update the
source file of dload.html and commit it. test it, it's sometimes buggy
(broken links etc).

done.
