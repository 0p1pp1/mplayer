Sending patches:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: We know these rules are hard, but it's hard to maintain such
big and complex project, so you should accept our rules. We have no
time for fixing buggy, broken or old patches!

1. Always make patch for the CVS version.
   We do not accept patches for old versions or releases.

2. Make unified diffs ('diff -Naur' or 'cvs diff -u')

3. Test functionality of your patch. We'll *refuse* it if it breaks
   something, even if it extends other features!

4. Read your patch. We'll *refuse* it if it changes indent of the
   code or it does tab/space or other cosmetical changes!

5. Comment parts what really needs it (has tricky side-effects etc).
   Commenting trivial code not requires. Comments must be english!
   
6. Do not ask for CVS write access at first time. If you contributed
   1 or more nice, acceptable patches and they need maintaining or
   you want to be mplayer developer, you'll get CVS write access.
   
7. Subscribe to the mplayer-dev-eng list (don't worry, it's low traffic)
   and send your patch there as base64-encoded attachment (use gzip or
   bzip2 *only* if it's really big or if you know that your mailer messes
   up (re-format) text attachments).
   Subject line should be: '[PATCH] very short description of the patch'.
   In the mail, describe in a few sentences what (and why) are the changes.
   If you made independent changes, try to send them as separate patches.

Thank you!
