TODO:

- more docs are coming as I find the time to write them down
- the frame rate is incorrect - WHY?? need sample, can't reproduce
  -> see still_stil_still.ram. it needs the value six bytes
  behind the frame rate. I have activated this for RV[23]0.
  The sample plays at 12fps (without this patch), realplay
  play it correctly with 15fps. - possibly DONE
- use RV20toYUV420Free()
- audio support - nearly DONE (look below)
- internet streaming support
- searching - we need to take care of the audio interleaving -
  haven't taken steps to locate audio key frames (does such thing
  exist?)
- some media files can't be played (mplayer crashes/fails) because
  it asks for decoded audio data, but the buffer in the audio
  demuxer packets are empty/missing. It seems that the necessary
  audio packets haven't been decoded completely (incomplete interleaving)
  the audio stream packets may get mixed with video stream packet
- put variables for audio streaming inside real_priv_t
- audio support for other formats than COOK - use a switch
  (like -forcereal) to activate it
