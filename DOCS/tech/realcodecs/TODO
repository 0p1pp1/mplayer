TODO:

- more docs are coming as I find the time to write them down
- USE_REALCODECS is needed in config.h -> configure
- the original player is doing something I don't know of:
  I compare the input and output data of the original and mplayer.
  While the input is the same, the ouput differs.
- the frame rate is incorrect
- use RV20toYUV420Free()
- rvyuvMain and the two format dwords should be stored inside
  st_context, so we don't use constants in the demuxer and the
  wrapper
- audio support (mainly for COOK)
- RV20 support
- internet streaming support
- searching
- get it to work before (they stream) the Bizarre festival
