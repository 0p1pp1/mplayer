TODO:

- USE_REALCODECS is needed in config.h -> configure - DONE
- the original player is doing something I don't know of:
  I compare the input and output data of the original and mplayer.
  While the input is the same, the ouput differs. - DONE
- the frame rate is incorrect - WHY?? need sample, can't reproduce
- use RV20toYUV420Free()
- rvyuvMain and the two format dwords should be stored inside
  st_context, so we don't use constants in the demuxer and the
  wrapper - DONE
- audio support (mainly for COOK)
- RV20 support - DONE
