A documentation about MPlayer's man page
========================================


About the documentation
-----------------------

Yes it's true: This is the documentation of the documentation (man page).
This guide should be used as a reference for questions about the man page
structure. It's not a strict guide but we recommend following it to get a
uniform man page.



What belongs in the man page?
-----------------------------

    - option descriptions (all)
    - usage (options, configuration files, controls)
    - basic examples



What doesn't belong in the man page?
------------------------------------

    - instructions for installation, encoding and similar processes
    - detailed evaluations or hints
    - tutorials, guides



How should patches look like?
-----------------------------

Follow the rules in patches.txt, they apply to the man page, too.
Exceptions are:

    - Cosmetic patches are allowed but should be done separately from the real
      changes, be marked as cosmetic changes and shouldn't change the general
      style without reasons/permissions.
    - The same applies to spell checking.



How do I create an HTML, text or other version of the man page?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The man page was more or less designed for groff as it is the main tool for
it. Therefore only groff produces acceptable results without changes.
Additionally, the SS variable should be set to either very low or very high
values to produce a better groff HTML output (Due to a bug of groff2html?).
A setting of 4 should look readable. Here's an overview again:

    - groff:     Groff is the "official" tool to convert man pages.
                 To get good results you need a recent version (1.18.2).
                 groff -m man -T html mplayer.1 > man_page.html
                 groff -m man -T ascii -rLL=78n mplayer.1 | col -bx > man_page.txt
                 The groff man page lists other output formats to use with -T.

    - man2html:  You can view it through a CGI script:
                 http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?mplayer
                 The output is unusable as the script doesn't seem to support
                 the macro definitions. Maybe manually changing all leads to
                 acceptable results.

    - rman:      rman -f html mplayer.1 > man_page.rman.html
                 The output is ugly as rman doesn't understand many of the
                 macros used.

    - troffcvt:  troff2html -man mplayer.1 > man_page.tcvt.html
                 The (good) output is similar to groff but simplified...



The structure
-------------

The option descriptions are divided into sections. Inside a section options are
alphabetically sorted. The sections are:

(Header)
    Not visible, copyright and author information.
(Macro definitions)
    Not visible, some macro definitions.

The man page/groff format
-------------------------

Just read this and RTFS:

    man 7 roff
    http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Man-Page.html
    man 7 man
    man 7 groff



"Style" guidelines
------------------

This section was kept simple but there are certain guidelines/rules to get a
uniform man page. The best way is to read (and understand) the source.


General:

    - No line should contain more than 79 characters.
    - Used commands: .TH, .SH, .TP, .IP, .PP, .[R]B, .I, .br, .RS, .RE, .na,
                     .nh, .ad, .hy, macro definitions, comments and some more
    - Don't forget the quotation marks around expressions, etc...
    - Each new sentence should start on a line of its own.
    - Put a backslash before a '-' if it denotes a range (1\-10), an option
      (\-fs), stdin (\-) or a dash (mplayer  \- Movie Player for Linux).
      Use just '-' if it is a hyphen (A-V) or a minus (-1). Please note that
      it should be \-dvd-device and not \-dvd\-device.


Option descriptions:

    - Options should be in alphabetical order.
    - Option and/or suboption parameters should be short, descriptive and put
      in angular brackets (e.g. \-vo <driver>).
    - If the option has a parameter in a certain range, specify it right after
      the option (e.g. \-subpos <0\-100>).
    - Optional things should be put in square brackets ([]).
    - Obsolete options are followed by (OBSOLETE), beta options by
      (BETA CODE), etc.
    - MPlayer only options in a section which isn't marked this way
      are followed by (MPLAYER only).
    - Add references to other options if they belong to each other, e.g.
      '(\-vo zr only)' or '(also see \-alang)' or are commonly used together.
    - If a nontrivial default parameter exists, mention it, e.g. (default: 24).
    - Put examples and notes at the end of the description (before suboptions).
    - The end of the suboptions _always_ has to be followed by a paragraph
      (BUG).
    - For flag options just document the non-default one of -XXX and -noXXX, if
      the option is not a flag, describe both, one below the other (this is an
      exception to the alphabetical order).


Macro definitions (see beginning of man page):

    - SS      Starting value of the suboption column
    - .IPs    Add new suboption (we use .TP for normal options and .IP for
              the rest)
    - .RSs    Begin of suboptions, end with .RE
    - .RSss   Begin of suboptions in a suboption
    - .REss   End of suboptions in a suboption
