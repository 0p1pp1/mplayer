Alternatively you can use GraphEdit Utility by M$ to find out the CLSID:
 - Get GraphEdit from either DirectX SDK or http://doom9.org
 - Open graphedit.exe
 - From menu select Graph->Insert Filters
 - Expand item "DirectShow Filters"
 - Choose right codec name and expand item
 - In the entry "DisplayName" look at the entry in winged brackets after
   the Backslash and write it down (five dash-delimited blocks)
 - The file given after "Filename" entry is the codec binary
