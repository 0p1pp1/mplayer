FOR THE RELEASE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AVI demuxer:
- fix AVI index offset base position handling ('no video steram found' bug)
- implement hardcore bruteforce avi re-sync for broken files (-forceidx)
- fix for growing avi files (movi_end pos > stream->end_pos)
- implement forward seeking in indexed avi streams

URGENT:
- finish mencoder -ovc vfw (bitrate setting, codec selection etc)
- mencoder: image cut/crop/extend filter, colorspace conversion
- codec priority option
- implement software scaling to vo_mpegpes
- ./configure support for XviD

runtime:
- add --enable-runtime or something (should change VERSION header and enable
  runtime cpu detect and print banner telling users to recompile for speed)
- runtime cpu detection in: 
     vo_dga.c (asm stuff may be removed and replaced by fastmemcpy?)
     libac3 (should be ported to liba52)
- test(fix?) mp3lib cpu detection code

FUTURE:
~~~~~~~

decoders:
- fix cvid on ppc
- getting mss1 (Windows Screen Video) DLL codec working... - kabi
- getting PIM1 codec (DLL) working... - kabi
- fix seeking with libmad audio codec (codec lost sync and can't resync?)

demuxer:
- demux_mpg: support for VDR's index files for more accurate seeking
- implement seeking for YUV4MPEG_2_, NuppelVideo and Real
- implement Ogg demuxer

decoders:
- qtx support?
- define some common api for native audio and video codecs
  and move them to seperated place (hopefully will allow adding new
  codecs without having to modify mplayer core code, also would speed
  up by limiting number of select statements)

mencoder:
- add ogg/vorbis audio encoder
- stop/resume

gui:
- playlist ?
- preferences ?

other:
- dvd server
- sub database
- mga_vid crtc2 fix
