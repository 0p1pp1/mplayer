FOR THE RELEASE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

URGENT:
- fix suid root
- check wmv8 with gcc 3.0x
- fix cvid on ppc
- add extra checks for spudec (5.element hun sub)
- add CRC checks for liba52

demuxer:
- prebuffering to cache2 (req. for MMS) - URGENT!

decoders:
- getting mss1 (Windows Screen Video) DLL codec working... - kabi
- getting PIM1 codec (DLL) working... - kabi
- getting 3ivX DLL working (CoCreateFreeThreadedMarshaler call required)
- optimize (or port optimized code from libac3) liba52 (imdct.c, resample.c)
- fix seeking with libmad audio codec (codec lost sync and can't resync?)
- fix ACELP DirectShow sound decoder (in avifile it's already fixed!)

mencoder:
- add some kind of "-ss" option, to start at e.g. 1:0:0 at the video
- add a endpoint for encoding, like above
- finish 3-pass encoding (audio, video1, video2)
- add win32 encoders support
- implement VBR audio copy
- Estimated Size and Time
- image cut/crop/extend filter
- add Divx4Linux encore detection to configure (#define DIVX4ENCORE)

other:
- fix DVB a-v sync problems, switch to mp1e

runtime:
- add --enable-runtime or something (should change VERSION header and enable
  runtime cpu detect and print banner telling users to recompile for speed)
- runtime cpu detection in: 
     vo_dga.c (asm stuff may be removed and replaced by fastmemcpy?)
     libac3 (should be ported to liba52)
- test(fix?) mp3lib cpu detection code
     

FUTURE:
~~~~~~~

demuxer:
- implement forward seeking in indexed avi streams
- implement brute-force broken avi fixer
- demux_mpg: support for VDR's index files for more accurate seeking
- implement seeking for YUV4MPEG(2), NuppelVideo and Real

decoders:
- check and import videodecoding.de stuff
- qtx support?
- define some common api for native audio and video codecs
  and move them to seperated place (hopefully will allow adding new
  codecs without having to modify mplayer core code, also would speed
  up by limiting number of select statements)

mencoder:
- add ogg/vorbis audio encoder
- stop/resume

gui:
- playlist ?
- preferences ?

other:
- dvd server
- sub database
- mga_vid crtc2 fix
- make mach64_vid
- make nvidia_vid ;)
- libvo2
- display OSD and subtitles using DVB card's OSD
