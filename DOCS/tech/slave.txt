SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
-------------------

FIXME: Some of these options are still not documented, patches welcome.

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options.
Have a look at the man page for more detailed descriptions.

If the -slave option is given, playback is controlled by a line-based protocol.
Each line must contain one of the following commands:

seek <value> [<type>]
    Seek to some place in the movie.
        0 is a relative seek of +/- <value> seconds (default).
        1 is a seek to <value> % in the movie.
        2 is a seek to an absolute position of <value> seconds.

speed_set <value>
    Set the speed to <value>.

speed_incr <value>
    Add <value> to the current playback speed.

speed_mult <value>
    Multiply the current speed by <value>.

edl_mark
    ???

audio_delay <value>
    Adjust the audio delay by <value> seconds.

quit [<value>]
    Quit MPlayer. The optional integer value is used as the return code
    for the mplayer process (default: 0).

    Pause/unpause the playback.

    When more than one source is available it selects the next/previous one
    (only supported by ASX playlist).

sub_delay <value> [<abs>]
    Adjust the subtitle delay by +/- <value> seconds or set it to <value>
    seconds when <abs> is nonzero.

    -sub options on the command line, VOBsubs, DVD subtitles, and Ogg text
    streams.

vobsub_lang
    This is a stub linked to sub_select for backwards compatibility.

get_percent_pos

get_time_length
    Print out the length of the current file in seconds.

vo_fullscreen

                1 = height
                2 = x position
                3 = y position
        <val2>
            If <val1> is 0 or 1:
                Integer amount to add/subtract from the width/height.
                Positive values add to width/height and negative values
                subtract from it.
            If <val1> is 2 or 3:
                Relative integer amount by which to move the upper left
