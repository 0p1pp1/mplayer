SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
-------------------

The -slave option switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend
for other programs. Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read
commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.

To try slave mode out by hand, run

  mplayer -slave -quiet <movie>

and type slave commands into the console window.

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options, though not
necessarily under the same name. Detailed descriptions can be found in the
man page.

All commands can be prefixed with "pausing ", causing MPlayer to pause as soon
as possible after processing the command. Please note that this can be before
the command is fully executed.

Available commands ('mplayer -input cmdlist' will print a list):


seek <value> [<type>]
    Seek to some place in the movie.
        0 is a relative seek of +/- <value> seconds (default).
        1 is a seek to <value> % in the movie.
        2 is a seek to an absolute position of <value> seconds.

speed_set <value>
    Set the speed to <value>.

speed_incr <value>
    Add <value> to the current playback speed.

speed_mult <value>
    Multiply the current speed by <value>.

edl_mark
    Write the current position into the EDL file.

audio_delay <value>
    Adjust the audio delay by <value> seconds.

quit [<value>]
    Quit MPlayer. The optional integer value is used as the return code
    for the mplayer process (default: 0).

pause
    Pause/unpause the playback.

frame_step
    Play one frame, then pause again.

grab_frames
    Currently unimplemented.

pt_step <value> [<force>]
    Go to the next/previous entry in the playtree. The sign of <value> tells
    the direction.  If no entry is available in the given direction it will do
    nothing unless force is non-zero.

pt_up_step <value> [<force>]
    Similar to pt_step but jumps to the next/previous entry in the parent list.
    Useful to break out of the inner loop in the playtree.

alt_src_step <value> (ASX playlist only)
    When more than one source is available it selects the next/previous one.

sub_delay <value> [<abs>]
    Adjust the subtitle delay by +/- <value> seconds or set it to <value>
    seconds when <abs> is nonzero.

sub_step <value>
    Step forward in the subtitle list by <value> steps or backwards if <value>
    is negative.

sub_load <subtitle_file>
    Loads subtitles from <subtitle_file>.

sub_remove [<value>]
    If the <value> argument is present and non-negative, removes the subtitle
    file with index <value>. If the argument is omitted or negative, removes
    all subtitle files.

osd [<level>]
    Toggle OSD mode or set it to level when <level> >= 0.

osd_show_text <string>
    Show <string> on the OSD.

volume <value>
    Increase/decrease volume.

use_master
    Switch volume control between master and PCM.

mute
    Mute/unmute sound output.

switch_audio [<value>] (MPEG and Matroska only)
    Switch to the audio track with the id <value>. Cycle through the
    available tracks if <value> is omitted or negative.

[contrast|gamma|brightness|hue|saturation] <-100 - 100> [<abs>]
    Set/adjust video parameters.

frame_drop [<value>]
    Toggle/set frame dropping mode.

sub_pos <value>
    Adjust subtitle position.

sub_alignment <value>
    Set subtitle alignment.

sub_visibility
    Toggle subtitle visibility.

get_sub_visibility
    Print out subtitle visibility (1 == on, 0 == off).

sub_select [<value>]
    Display subtitle with index <value>. Turn subtitle display off if
    <value> is -1 or greater than the highest available subtitle index.
    Cycle through the available subtitles if <value> is omitted or less
    than -1. Supported subtitle sources are -sub options on the command
    line, VOBsubs, DVD subtitles, and Ogg and Matroska text streams.

sub_log
    Logs the current or last displayed subtitle together with filename
    and time information to ~/.mplayer/subtitle_log. Intended purpose
    is to allow convenient marking of bogus subtitles which need to be
    fixed while watching the movie.

vobsub_lang
    This is a stub linked to sub_select for backwards compatibility.

get_percent_pos
    Print out the current position in the file, as integer percentage [0-100).

get_time_pos
    Print out the current position in the file in seconds, as float.

get_time_length
    Print out the length of the current file in seconds.

vo_fullscreen
    Switch to fullscreen mode.

get_vo_fullscreen
    Print out fullscreen status (1 == fullscreened, 0 == windowed).

vo_ontop
    Toggle stay-on-top.

vo_rootwin
    Toggle playback on the root window.

switch_vsync [<value>]
    Toggle vsync (1 == on, 0 == off). If no value is provided,
    vsync status is inverted.

switch_ratio [<value>]
    Change aspect ratio at runtime. Value is the new aspect ratio expressed
    as a float (e.g. 1.77778 for 16/9).
    There might be problems with some video filters.

panscan <-1.0 - 1.0> | <0.0 - 1.0> <absolute>
    Increase or decrease the pan-and-scan range by <value>, 1.0 is the maximum.
    Negative values decrease the pan-and-scan range.
    If <absolute> is != 0, then the pan-and scan range is interpreted as an
    absolute range.

loadfile <file|url> <append>
    Load the given file/URL.
    If <append> is 0 or not given playback of the current file will be stopped
    and the playlist replaced. Otherwise it will only be added to the playlist.

loadlist <file> <append>
    Load the given playlist file.
    If <append> is 0 or not given playback of the current file will be stopped
    and the playlist replaced. Otherwise it will only be added to the playlist.

change_rectangle <val1> <val2>
    Change the position of the rectangle filter rectangle.
        <val1>
            Must be one of the following:
                0 = width
                1 = height
                2 = x position
                3 = y position
        <val2>
            If <val1> is 0 or 1:
                Integer amount to add/subtract from the width/height.
                Positive values add to width/height and negative values
                subtract from it.
            If <val1> is 2 or 3:
                Relative integer amount by which to move the upper left
                rectangle corner. Positive values move the rectangle
                right/down and negative values move the rectangle left/up.
