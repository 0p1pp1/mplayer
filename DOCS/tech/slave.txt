SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
-------------------

The -slave option switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backend
for other programs. Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will read
commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.

To try slave mode out by hand, run

  mplayer -slave -quiet <movie>

and type slave commands into the console window.

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options, though not
necessarily under the same name. Detailed descriptions can be found in the
man page.

All commands can be prefixed with "pausing ", causing MPlayer to pause as soon
as possible after processing the command. Please note that this can be before
the command is fully executed.


Available commands ('mplayer -input cmdlist' will print a list):


alt_src_step <value> (ASX playlist only)
    When more than one source is available it selects the next/previous one.

audio_delay <value>
    Adjust the audio delay by <value> seconds.

[brightness|contrast|gamma|hue|saturation] <-100 - 100> [<abs>]
    Set/adjust video parameters.

change_rectangle <val1> <val2>
    Change the position of the rectangle filter rectangle.
        <val1>
            Must be one of the following:
                0 = width
                1 = height
                2 = x position
                3 = y position
        <val2>
            If <val1> is 0 or 1:
                Integer amount to add/subtract from the width/height.
                Positive values add to width/height and negative values
                subtract from it.

                Relative integer amount by which to move the upper left
                rectangle corner. Positive values move the rectangle

pt_step <value> [<force>]

    Displays help text, currently empty.

exit
    Exits from OSD menu console. Unlike 'quit', does not quit MPlayer.

hide
    Hides the OSD menu console. Clicking a menu command unhides it. Other
    keybindings act as usual.

run <value>
    Run <value> as shell command. In OSD menu console mode stdout and stdin
    are through the video output driver.
