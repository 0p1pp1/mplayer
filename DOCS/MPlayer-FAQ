Yes, this is the MPlayer FAQ.
=============================

About:
~~~~~~
Many people asked same questions so I decided to write this stuff.
I know that people will never read this but at least i try to
pull down number of these mails.
And from now i can say that "read the fuckin' FAQ!" :-)

Let's ask!
~~~~~~~~~~
Q: What about DVD playback?
A: Read files 'DVD' and 'DVD-FAQ'.

Q: SDL output doesn't work or compile. Problem is ....
A: It is tested with newest SDL (probably runs on 1.1.7+).
   It does NOT work with 1.1.6, 1.1.5 1.1.4 1.1.3 1.0.4 etc, don't ask.

Q: I am still having trouble compiling with SDL support. gcc says something
   about "undefined reference to `SDL_EnableKeyRepeat'"   What's now?
A: Where did you install the SDL library? If you installed in /usr/local
   (the default) then edit the top level config.mak and add
   "-L/usr/local/lib " after "X_LIBS=" Now type make. You're done!

Q: I have problem ... with the SDL driver.
A: It's very experimental & buggy code, and it's UNSUPPORTED by us.
   Please do NOT report bugs or ask features relating to SDL.
   If you can improve it, send us patches!

Q: It doesn't compile, and it misses uint64_t inttypes.h and similar things...
A: copy DOCS/inttypes.h to MPlayer directory (cp DOCS/inttypes.h .)
   try again... if fail, contact me

Q: I have Pentium III but ./configure doesn't detect SSE
A: Only kernel versions 2.4.x supports SSE (or try latest 2.2.19 or newer, but
   be prepared for problems)

Q: -xy option doesn't work with x11 driver (-vo x11)
A: x11 driver doesn't support scaling, but XF86VidMode support is now
   used: you must specify the -vm and the -fs switch, and you're done.
   Make sure you have the right Modelines in your XF86Config file, and
   try if the DGA driver (and SDL's DGA driver, see VIDEOCARDS) works for you.
   It's much faster. If SDL's DGA works too, use that, it'll be EVEN
   faster!

Q: audio goes out of sync playing .avi file
A: try with -bps or -nobps option
   if still bad, send me (upload to ftp) that file, I'll check.

Q: what is the meaning of numbers in the status line?
A: see:
     A:   2.1  V:   2.2  A-V: -0.167  ct:  0.042   57  41%   0%  2.6% 0
   - A: audio position in seconds
   - V: video position in seconds
   - A-V: audio-video difference in seconds (delay)
   - ct: total A-V sync correction done
   - frames played (counting from last seek)
   - video codec cpu usage in percent (for mpeg it includes video_out too!)
   - video_out cpu usage for avi, 0 for mpg (see above)
   - audio codec cpu usage in percent
   - dropped bad frames (mpg only)
   Most of them are for debug purposes, and will be removed soon.

Q: Why is video_out cpu usage zero (0%) for mpeg files?
A: It's not zero, but it's built in into codec, so can't be measured separated.
   You should try to play the file using -vo null and then -vo ... and check
   the difference to see video_out speed...

Q: OpenGL (-vo gl) output doesn't work (hangup/black window/X11 errors/...)
A: your opengl driver doesn't support dynamic texture chanegs (glTexSubImage)
   it's known not to work with X 4.0.x DRI drivers and nVidia's binary shit.
   it's known to work with Utah-GLX and Matrox G400 card.
   it will not work with 3DFX cards because the 256x256 texture size limit.

Q: I have G200/G400, how to compile/use mga_vid driver?
A: read VIDEOCARDS, INSTALL, README

Q: What's XMMP? (it's XMMS or XMPS but mispelled?)
A: It's a new project, see http://frozenproductions.com for details

Q: There are error messages about file not found /usr/lib/win32/....
A: Download & install w32codec.zip from *our* FTP
   (avifile's codec package has different DLL set)

Q: ...... works with avifile/aviplay while doesn't with MPlayer
A: MPlayer != avifile
   The only common thing between these players is the Win32 DLL loader.
   The codecs (dll) sets, syncronization, demultiplexing etc is totaly
   different and shouldn't be compared.
   If something works with aviplay it doesn't mean that MPlayer should do
   it and vice versa. You should contact me, I'll fix the bug!

Q: Indeo 3.x/4.x movies are viewed upside-down!!!?
A: It's a known bug (really it's a bug/limitation of the DLL codec)

Q: Indeo 3.x,4.x video doesn't work at 32bpp resolutions (16,24 bpp are ok)
A: It's a known bug (really it's a bug/limitation of the DLL codec)

Q: I've got 'MPlayer interrupted by signal 11' in module audio_setup or
   decode_audio.
A: This is highly unlikely, since the mp3lib rewrite. Contact us, it may be
   a bug. Possibly it's a damaged file, try with -afm 4 .

Q: Are there rpm/deb/... packages of MPlayer?
A: You can make a .deb package for yourself, check DOCS/DEBIAN .
   It's _STRONGLY_ discouraged to use precompiled packages
   of MPlayer, since it (currently) _highly_ depends on compile-time
   options and optimizations!
   Precompiled packages are COMPLETELY unsupported by the MPlayer team!

Q: Are there any mailing lists on MPlayer?
A: Yes! See README on how to subscribe them!

Q: I've found a nasty bug when I tried to play my favourite video!!
   Who should I inform?
A: See DOCS/BUGREPORTS

Q: During 'make', MPlayer complains about X11 libraries. I don't understand,
   I DO have X installed!?
A: ...but you don't have the X development package installed. Or not
   correctly. It's called XFree86-devel* under RedHat, and xlib6g-dev* under
   Debian.  Also check if the /usr/X11 symlink exists (this can be a problem on
   Mandrake systems). It can be created with the
	$ ln -sf /usr/X11R6 /usr/X11
   command. Also check the /usr/include/X11 link :
	$ ln -sf /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11
   Your distribution may differ from the Linux Filesystem Standard.

Q: I have problems playing files with ... codec. Can I use'em?
A: Check http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/DOCS/codecs.html,
   if it doesn't contain your codec, read
   http://mplayer.sourceforge.net/DOCS/CODECS, and contact us.

Q: What about DGA driver? I can't find it!!!
A: ./configure autodetects your DGA driver. If -vo help doesn't show
   DGA, then there's a problem with your X installation.
   Try ./configure --enable-dga (and read VIDEOCARDS)
   Alternatively, try SDL's DGA driver with '-vo sdl -sdl dga' options.

Q: Ok, -vo help shows DGA driver, but it is babbling about permissions!
   Help me!
A: It works only if running as root! It's a DGA limitation.
   You should become to root (su -), and try again.

   Another solution is making mplayer SUID root, but its NOT RECOMMENDED!
       'chown root /usr/local/bin/mplayer'
       'chmod 750 /usr/local/bin/mplayer'
       'chmod +s /usr/local/bin/mplayer'
   !!!! BUT STAY TUNED !!!!
   This is a *BIG* security risk! *NEVER* do this on a server or on a computer
   can be accessed by more people than only you because they can gain root
   privilegies through suid root mplayer!!!
   !!!! SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ... !!!!

Q: The fsdga driver doesn't work with my xyz.avi file. Why is that?
A: Because it only works with MPEG. (yet)

Q: When using Xvideo, my Voodoo 3/Banshee says:
   X Error of failed request:  BadAccess (attempt to access private resource
   denied)
    Major opcode of failed request:  147 (MIT-SHM)
    Minor opcode of failed request:  1 (X_ShmAttach)
    Serial number of failed request:  26
    Current serial number in output stream:27 
A: Your driver is old, update it.

Q: When using Xvideo, I can't play DivX avis with my Voodoo 3/Banshee !
   It says:
    ...
    Xvideo image format: 0x32315659 (YV12) planar
    Xvideo image format: 0x30323449 (I420) planar
    ...
A: Your driver is old, update it. The new driver also supports YUY2 required
   for DivX.

Q: I've downloaded an ASF with asfrecorder, but MPlayer can't play it !
A: asfrecorder, and the ASF format itself is a big crap.
   Do not contact us, go to hell.

Q: Umm, what is "IdegCounter" ?
A: A mixture of a hungarian and an english word. In english, "Ideg" means
   "nerve", and is pronounced as something like "ydaegh" . It was first used
   to measure the nervousness of A'rpi, after some (umm) "mystic" disappearance
   of CVS code ;)

Q: I can't compile SVGAlib.. I'm using 2.3/2.4 kernel.
A: You have to edit SVGAlib's Makefile.cfg and comment "BACKGROUND = y" out.

Q: LIRC doesn't work, because ...
A: Are you sure you use "mplayer_lirc" instead of "mplayer" ?

Q: MPlayer exits with something error when using l3codeca.acm
A: Check 'ldd /usr/local/bin/mplayer' output. If it contains
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4???????)
   where "?" is any number then it's ok, the error is not here. If it is:
	libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00??????)
   then there is problem with your kernel/libc. Maybe you are using some
   security patches (for example Solar Designer's OpenWall patch) which
   forces loading libraries to very low addresses.
   Because l3codeca.acm is a non-relocatable DLL, it must be loaded to
   0x00400000, we can't change this. You should use non-patched kernel,
   or use MPlayer's -afm 1 option to disable using l3codeca.acm.

Q: My computer plays M$ DivX AVIs with resolutions ~ 640x300 and stereo mp3
   sound too slow. When I use -nosound switch, everything is ok (but quiet).
A: Those files probably have 48Khz audio, and your soundcard/driver can't play
   it correctly. Audio downsampling isn't implemented in MPlayer (yet).

Q: I'd like to use/port MPlayer on/to my <insert your favourite architecture
   here> on <insert your favourite OS here> . Is it possible?
A: No.

Q: But...!
A: No.

Q: And if MPEG is sufficient?
A: Maybe. But you better look for already existant MPEG players on that
   platform.

Q: MPlayer dies with "MPlayer interrupted by signal 4 in module: decode_video".
A: Try running MPlayer on the machine you compiled on. Or recompile. Don't
   use MPlayer on different CPU that it was compiled on.
