How to use a Sigma Designs Hollywood Plus and/or a Creative DXR3 by David Holm
==============================================================================

Thanks goes out to Daniel Bell for the donation of a brand new 20GB IBM
harddisk.

1. Requirements

 * First of all you will need the DXR3/H+ drivers properly installed.
   Version 0.12.0 or later. You can find it at
   http://dxr3.sourceforge.net/
   (you only need to run "make install devices" in em8300-x.y.z/modules
    not in the root dir)

 * Run <mplayerdir>/configure and make sure that DXR3/H+ support = yes
   if you want to play files other than mpeg I highly recommend you install
   libavcodec as well (Read DOCS/codecs.html for more info).
   
 From here on compilation (of at least my code ;) should go without any
 problems.



2. Usage
    -vo dxr3:<noprebuf>:<codec>:<device>Where noprebuf specifies to turn off
					prebuffering. This is done automatically
					on athlons. If playback is out of sync
					try disabling prebuffering. If noprebuf
					is left out prebuffering is enabled
					(except on athlons).
					
					<codec> = fame/avcodec, avcodec produces
					better quality output, but fame is
					faster for those of you with slow
					machines. The default is to use
					libavcodec. Note that you need
					libavcodec properly installed (read
					DOCS/codecs.html)
					
					<device> = device number to use in case
					you have more than one em8300 card
					
					Any of these options may be left out,
					but they must be specified in this order
					i.e. dxr3:fame works, dxr3:1 works but
					dxr3:1:avcodec will not.
					These new features were added by XorA,
					he usually hangs out in #dxr3 on
					irc.openprojects.net, let him know
					you like it...
    -ao oss:/dev/em8300_ma-X		For audio output, where X is the device
					number (0 if one card)
    -ac hwac3				For digital audio output instead of
					analog
    -vc mpegpes				Force hardware acceleration, only works
					with mpeg1/2
    -aop list=resample:fout=xxxxx	If samplerate is below 44100Hz, select
					either 44100 or 48000 depending on
					which which one matches closest. I.e.
					if the movie uses 22050 use 44100 as
					44100 / 2 = 22050, if it's 24000 use
					48000 as 48000 / 2 = 24000 and so on.
 					This does not work with digital audio
					output (-ac hwac3)

Overlay
To get overlay run dxr3view that comes with the em8300 package before staring
mplayer. You can set various options in dxr3view by pressing T while holding
the mouse cursor above the window.

MPEG-1, MPEG-2, VCD and DVD Notes
MPEG 1/2 content should now automatically be detected by mplayer and it will
use the hardware acceleration of the DXR3 to play it. If not, you can force
it to hardware acceleration with -vc mpegpes. Also, if you plan to use any
postprocessing filters you must use -vc mpeg12.
