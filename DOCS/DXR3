How to use a Sigma Designs Hollywood Plus and/or a Creative DXR3 by David Holm
==============================================================================

Thanks goes out to Daniel Bell for the donation of a brand new 20GB IBM
harddisk.

1. Requirements

 * First of all you will need the DXR3/H+ drivers properly installed.
   Version 0.12.0 or later. You can find it at
   http://dxr3.sourceforge.net/
   (you only need to run "make install devices" in em8300-x.y.z/modules
    not in the root dir)

 * Run <mplayerdir>/configure and make sure that DXR3/H+ support = yes
   if you want to play files other than mpeg libmp1e should be = yes as well
   
 From here on compilation (of at least my code ;) should go without any
 problems.



2. Usage
    -vo dxr3:<noprebuf>:<codec>:<device>Where noprebuf specifies to turn off
					prebuffering. This is done automatically
					on athlons. If playback is out of sync
					try disabling prebuffering. If noprebuf
					is left out prebuffering is enabled
					(except on athlons).
					
					<codec> = fame/avcodec, avcodec produces
					better quality output, but fame is
					faster for those of you with slow
					machines. The default is to use
					libavcodec. Note that you need
					libavcodec properly installed (read
					DOCS/codecs.html)
					
					<device> = device number to use in case
					you have more than one em8300 card
					
					Any of these options may be left out,
					but they must be specified in this order
					i.e. dxr3:fame works, dxr3:1 works but
					dxr3:1:avcodec will not.
					These new features were added by XorA,
					he usually hangs out in #dxr3 on
					irc.openprojects.net, let him know
					you like it...
    -ao oss:/dev/em8300_ma-X		For audio output, where X is the device
					number (0 if one card)
    -ac hwac3				For digital audio output instead of
					analog
    -vc mpegpes				For hardware accelerated mpeg playback
    -aop list=resample:fout=48000	If samplerate is below 44100Hz
 					This does not work with digital audio
					output (-ac hwac3)

MPEG-1, MPEG-2, VCD and DVD Notes
There are some important notes to take into account here for optimum playback.
MPlayer currently does not autodetect that the dxr3 can playback mpegs. So for
mpeg files, dvd's and vcd's you have to add -vc mpegpes to tell mplayer that
you are using a hardware accelerator. Otherwise mplayer will decode the movie
in software, which is much slower.
Note that you cannot use -vc mpegpes with movies that aren't mpeg 1 or 2 or
you will get an error message saying "Can't find codec for video format...".
