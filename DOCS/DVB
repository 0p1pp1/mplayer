Some words about Siemens-DVB card support.         by A'rpi
==========================================

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Siemens DVB-S card or compatible (technotrend,galaxis,hauppage etc)
  see www.linuxtv.org for details and download latest driver there.
- MPlayer-CVS, ffmpeg-libavcodec CVS are recommended for speed & pp.
- Fast CPU - 1GHz+ recommended at least for software transcoding (divx->mpeg)


How to enable?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download ffmpeg-CVS and copy libavcodec to mplayer (see DOCS for details)

2. Compile mplayer:
    ./configure should detect it. If didn't, force with ./configure --enable-dvb
        If you have ost headers at non-standard path, set it with:
	--with-extraincdir=<your DVB source dir>/ost/include
    make
    make install
   

How to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~
To play standard mpeg 1/2 files:  (hardware decoding)

  mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes file.mpg|vob

To play non-standard mpeg files:  (software decoding)

  mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes -vc mpeg12 file.mpg|vob

To play divx files:

  mplayer -ao mpegpes -vo mpegpes file.avi|asf|mov...
  
To play non-25fps movies, or with slow CPU, add option:  -framedrop

Image size:
~~~~~~~~~~~
DVB card allows only 2 vertical resolutions: 288 and 576.
If your video height differs, you have to clip it or extend by adding
black bands. It's done by mplayer, just specify image size using the
-x and -y options. You must use either -y 288 or -y 576.

To force pan&scan (16:9 at 4:3 TV), add options:  -x 352 -y 288

If you have powerfull CPU, you can also scale image up, using the
swscale filter. For example, to watch a 640x288 video fullscreen,
use -vop scale=640:400
Note that you don't have to scale horizontally, the card will do it
by hardware, but you have to scale vertically keeping the aspect ratio.


Mailing list:

List's language is ENGLISH. Please avoid using german or other languages!
Subscribe, and ask/discuss your problems here.
I'll also post feature announces to this list.

Future plans/TODO:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- display OSD and subtitles using DVB card's OSD feature
- better (more fluent) playback of non-25fps movies
- realtime transcoding between mpeg2 <-> mpeg4 (partial decompression)
- better quality for lowres mpeg1
