Some words about Siemens-DVB card support.         by A'rpi
==========================================

NOTE: this is very experimental!

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Siemens DVB-S card or compatible (technotrend,galaxis,hauppage etc)
  see www.linuxtv.org for details and download latest driver there.
- MPlayer-CVS, ffmpeg-libavcodec. divx4linux is recommended for speed & pp.
- Fast CPU - at least for software decoding (divx...)


How to enable?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Edit libvo/vo_mpegpes.c, and change first #undef HAVE_DVB to:
    #define HAVE_DVB

2. Download ffmpeg-CVS and copy libavcodec to mplayer (see DOC for details)
   Move this line from #ifdef CONFIG_ENCODERS .. #endif section to outside
   (after the #endif line) at libavcodec/utils.c:361 :
       register_avcodec(&mpeg1video_encoder);
   
3. Compile mplayer:
    run ./configure with the option:
	--with-extraincdir=<your DVB source dir>/ost/include
    make
    make install

How to use?
~~~~~~~~~~~
To play standard mpeg 1/2 files:  (hardware decoding)

  mplayer -vo mpegpes -vc mpegpes file.mpg|vob

To play non-standard mpeg files:  (software decoding)

  mplayer -vo mpegpes file.mpg|vob

To play divx files:

  mplayer -vo mpegpes -vc ffdivx|odivx file.avi|asf
  
To play non-25fps movies, or with slow CPU, add option:  -framedrop

Image size:
~~~~~~~~~~~
DVB card allows only 2 vertical resolutions: 288 and 576.
If your video height differs, you have to clip it or extend by adding
black bands. It's done by mplayer, just specify image size using the
-x and -y options. You must use either -y 288 or -y 576.

To force pan&scan (16:9 at 4:3 TV), add options:  -x 352 -y 288

Mailing list:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  http://mplayerhq.hu/mailman/listinfo/mplayer-dvb

Subscribe, and ask/discuss your problems here.
I'll also post feature announces to this list.

Future plans/TODO:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- audio playback through the DVB card (currently it uses soundcard)
- display OSD and subtitles using DVB card's OSD feature
- better (more fluent) playback of non-25fps movies
- more speed optimizations
- YUY2 support (for win32 codecs, like Indeo5 and WMV 7/8)
- realtime transcoding between mpeg2 <-> mpeg4 (partial decompression)
