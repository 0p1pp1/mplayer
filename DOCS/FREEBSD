Notes for FreeBSD users
=======================

1. To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /usr/ports/devel/gmake), 
native BSD make will not work.

2. Configure script is different for FreeBSD; use configure.FreeBSD instead.

3. To run mplayer you will need to re-compile the kernel with 
"options USER_LDT" (unless you are running -CURRENT, where this is default).

4. There's no VCD (well, it is not finished) or DVD support for FreeBSD yet. 
Feel free to add them :-)

Enjoy (as do I)!
