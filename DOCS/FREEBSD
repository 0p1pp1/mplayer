Notes for FreeBSD users
=======================

1. To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /usr/ports/devel/gmake), 
native BSD make will not work.

2. To run mplayer you will need to re-compile the kernel with 
"options USER_LDT" (unless you are running -CURRENT, where this is default).

3. If mplayer complains about "CD-ROM Device '/dev/cdrom' not found!" make a 
symbolic link : ln -s /dev/<your_cdrom_device> /dev/cdrom 

4. There's no DVD support for FreeBSD yet. 
Feel free to add them :-)

Enjoy (as do I)!
