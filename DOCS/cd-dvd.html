<P><B><A NAME=4.1>4.1. CD-ROM drives</A></B></P>

<P>Playing standard Video CDs:</P>

<P>
mplayer -vcd <I>trackno</I> [device]<BR><BR>
Examples:<BR>
mplayer -vcd 1<BR>
mplayer -fs -vcd 2 /dev/hdc<BR>
</P>

<P>
Notes:<BR>
- Do NOT mount VCD disks and play DAT files directly! It may work under windows
but won't work under linux. You have to play them directly, with the -vcd
option!<BR>
- VCD disks usually have 2 tracks: a data track (containing autostart windows
playback program, karaoke data etc) and a mode-2 track (the movie), so try
-vcd 2 first!<BR>
- the default VCD device is /dev/cdrom. if your device differs, then you have
to make a symlink, or specify it in command line!
</P>

<P>From Linux documentation:</P>

<P>Some CDROM drives are capable of changing their head-speed. There are several
reasons for changing the speed of a CDROM drive. Badly pressed CDROMs may
benefit from less-than-maximum head rate. Modern CDROM drives can obtain very
high head rates (up to 24-times is common).  It has been reported that these
drives can make reading errors at these high speeds, reducing the speed can
prevent data loss in these circumstances.  Finally, some of these drives can
make an annoyingly loud noise, which a lower speed may reduce.</P>

<P>The recommended way to do it is with a program called 'setcd' . It's kinda
old, but won't be too hard to find on the Net. (UPDATE : new hdparm
has an option for this !)
Use it with :</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>setcd -x [speed] [cdrom device]</CODE></P>

<P>Also you can try:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>echo current_speed:4 >/proc/ide/[cdrom device]/settings</CODE></P>

<P>but you'll need root privileges. I use following command too:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>echo file_readahead:2000000 >/proc/ide/[cdrom device]/settings</CODE></P>

<P>for 2MB prefetched reading from the file (it's useful for scratched CDROMs).
It's recommended that you tuneup your CDROM drive also with hdparm:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>hdparm -d1 -a8 -u1 (cdrom device)</CODE></P>

<P>to enable using DMA access, readahead, and IRQ unmasking.
(if you don't understand these, *read the hdparm manpage*)</P>

<P>Please refer to "<CODE>/proc/ide/[cdrom device]/settings</CODE>" for fine-tuning your
CDROM.</P>

<P><B><A NAME=4.2>4.2. DVD playback</A></B></P>
  
<P>Yes, the real DVD support has been arrived. You don't need to play VOB files
manually from disk thinking of the purpose of a file in the video_ts
directory, you don't need worry it it's an encrypted disk or not (in old
<B>MPlayer</B> you had to put '-dvdauth /dev/dvd' into the command line in case
of encrypted discs), and you don't need even mount your disk to be able to
play :)</P>
  
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: please _DO_NOT_ require further features for DVD playback.
This is the first version of some real DVD support inside <B>MPlayer</B> and
we're busy with hunting bugs and implementing basic DVD player features.</P>

<P><B>MPlayer</B> uses libdvdread which has got built in support for IFO parsing,
reading navi blocks and doing authentication/descrambling. libdvdread
use the good old libcss to the latter tasks. So you will need libcss and
libdvdread downloaded, compiled and installed BEFORE you run ./configure
script of <B>MPlayer</B> which will autodetect libdvdread for you in this way.</P>

<UL>  
<LI><P><B>Download source of libdvdread 0.8 and libcss.</B></P>
  
<P><I>You can download them from
<A HREF="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd">http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd</A>
(click 'download' in the menu at the left, and you can find libcss and
libdvdread in a table).</I></P></LI>
  
<LI><P><B>Compile and install libcss THEN libdvdread.</B></P>
    
<P><I>Read documentation of these packages to do this step easily.</I></P></LI>
  
<LI><P><B>Recompile MPlayer.</B></P>
  
<P><I>Run <CODE>./configure</CODE>. If you install libdvdread correctly, ./configure
says something similar:<BR><CODE>Checking for DVDread support ... yes</CODE><BR>
(Of course you can put your favourite configure options into the command
line when you run ./configure). That's it! Say: <CODE>make</CODE>, then <CODE>make install</CODE>.</I></P></LI>
</UL>

<P>Of course after installing libcss and libdvdread you don't need recompile
them at each time when you want to recompile <B>MPlayer</B> (from a new CVS version
for example) since the needed packages have already been installed on your
machine.</P>

<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>Q:</TD><TD WIDTH=100%><B>
Can I compile libdvdread and libcss for example on my sweet Sparc/Solaris?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
Who knows ... Please test it and send feedback. But it's said that it
should work. Please refer documentation of libdvdread and its homepage
as well. We're not authors of libdvdread.

<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>Q:</TD><TD WIDTH=100%><B>
What about subtitles? Can MPlayer decode them?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
Yes it can (or at least it would be able to) but there is now DVD subtitle
displaying functionality inside <B>MPlayer</B> (DVD subs are stored as images,
not text!). However it's a planned feature (at the time of libvo2).
</TD><TR><TD COLSPAN=3>&nbsp;</TD><TR>

<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>Q:</TD><TD WIDTH=100%><B>
I've got no sound / bad sound (Spanish audio and other ugly things).
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
<B>MPlayer</B> currently does not use all of information of IFO blocks from DVD.
You can adjust the right DVD audio stream with: '-aid 128' command line
option, where 128 is the stream id of requested audio stream. You can
experience with numbers of 128,129,... and so on. Of course this problem
will be solved in the future.

<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>Q:</TD><TD WIDTH=100%><B>
There is some strange effect (interlace like thing) especially when fast
moving objects are shown in the movie.

Known problem, we try to fix it later (when we switch to libvo2).

How can I set the region code of my DVD-Drive ? I don't have windows!

Use the 'regionset' tool:

<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>Q:</TD><TD WIDTH=100%><B>
So MPlayer can play DVDs? Then it must use DeCSS! You are under arrest
under the XYZ#$ paragraph of the--
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
Get back asshole, there is no DeCSS code in <B>MPlayer</B>. <B>MPlayer</B> uses libdvdread
by linking against it, and libdvdread uses libcss by dynamic loading it.

<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>Q:</TD><TD WIDTH=100%><B>
Do I need to be (setuid) root/setuid fibmap_mplayer to be able to play DVD?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
No, you don't. This is the past :) However of course you must have got
the proper rights to the DVD device driver entry (in /dev).

How can I ... (insert some expectable DVD player feature here)?
</B></TD><TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top>A:</TD><TD>
The current implementation is the first implementation of some real DVD

basic features before implementing new features.
