TO DO:
~~~~~~
Urgent:
- support for more codecs  (sample .avi files and .dll needed!) - HELP!
- make a release!
- change to libxmm

They Have Been Around For A Long Time:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
High Priority:
- finish ASF seeking (find next keyframe)
- asterix.avi audio delays after 5-10 mins (bps mode only)
- fix mp3lib to avoid segfault with some damaged .avi files

Medium Priority:
- seeking support for broken avi files without index chunk
- fix x11 driver to work without SHM (for remote playing etc)
- show current frame number [Gabucino]
- seek_to_frame and seek_to_index options
- audio copy/encoding capability

Low Priority:
- fix X4.0.x/DRI OpenGL (doesn't really work, at least mga & tdfx & nvidia)
- support for MPEG TS (transport streams) - I need sample files!
- integrating the gui?
