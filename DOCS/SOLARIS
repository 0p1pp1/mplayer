Notes for Solaris users
=======================

1. To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /opt/sfw/gmake), 
native Solaris make will not work.

2. For DVD support you must have the patched libcss installed. Patch:
   http://www.tools.de/solaris/mplayer/

3. Due to two bugs in solaris 8 x86,  you cannot reliably play DVDs using a
   capacity >4GB: 

   - The sd(7D) driver on solaris 8 x86 driver has bug when accessing a
     disk block >4GB on a device using a logical blocksize != DEV_BSIZE
     (i.e. CDROM and DVD media).  Due to a 32bit int overflow, a disk
     address modulo 4GB is accessed.

   - The similar bug is present in the hsfs(7FS) filesystem code (aka ISO9660),
     hsfs currently does not support partitions/disks >4GB,  all data is
     accessed modulo 4GB
