Notes for Solaris users
=======================

1. It *only* works on Solaris x86.  It can't work on SPARC systems due to
   the use of win32 codecs.


2. To build the package you will need GNU make (gmake, /opt/sfw/gmake), 
   native Solaris make will not work.  

   Typical error you get when building with solaris' make instead of GNU
   make:

   % /usr/ccs/bin/make
   make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 122: Unexpected end of line seen


3. You also need the GNU assembler;  and the GNU C compiler, configured to use
   the GNU assembler.  The mplayer code makes heavy use of MMX, SSE and 3DNOW!
   instructions that cannot be compiled using Sun's assembler /usr/ccs/bin/as.

   Use the "--as=/whereever/you/have/installed/gnu-as" option to tell
   configure where it can find GNU as on your system.

   Typical error you get when building with a GNU C compiler that does
   not use GNU as:

   % gmake
   ...
   gcc -c -Iloader -Ilibvo -O4 -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -ffast-math 
	   -fomit-frame-pointer  -I/usr/local/include   -o mplayer.o mplayer.c
   Assembler: mplayer.c
   "<stdin>", line 3567 : Illegal mnemonic
   "<stdin>", line 3567 : Syntax error
   ... more "Illegal mnemonic" and "Syntax error" errors ...


4. For DVD support you must have the patched libcss installed. Patch:

5. Due to two bugs in solaris 8 x86,  you cannot reliably play DVDs using a
   capacity >4GB: 

   - The sd(7D) driver on solaris 8 x86 driver has bug when accessing a
     disk block >4GB on a device using a logical blocksize != DEV_BSIZE
     (i.e. CDROM and DVD media).  Due to a 32bit int overflow, a disk
     address modulo 4GB is accessed.

   - The similar bug is present in the hsfs(7FS) filesystem code (aka ISO9660),
     hsfs currently does not support partitions/disks >4GB,  all data is
     accessed modulo 4GB
