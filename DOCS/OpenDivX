OpenDivX support in MPlayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See http://www.projectmayo.com for details on the OpenDivX codec.
It's the opensource successor of the DivX codec, already available
on most platforms. We use an MMX-optimized Decore.
OpenDivX version supported in MPlayer : 4.0alpha48

Decoder:
~~~~~~~~
Now it's used for AVI files with fourcc 'dvx1'
You can adjust Quality level using the -pp option.
Combine (add) flags you need:

1   Y  horizontal deblocking
2   Y  vertical deblocking
4   C  horizontal deblocking
8   C  vertical deblocking
16  Y dering
32  C dering

For example, if you want horiz+vert chroma deblocking, then use
  -pp 12    (4+8=12)

Note: C filters works only with n*16 height movies.

Encoder:
~~~~~~~~
There is a very alpha hack to convert video into OpenDivX .avi files.
Audio is automatically disabled. Select 'odivx' video device as output:
  mplayer input.mpg -vo odivx -encode output.avi
Yes, I know that it's unusable now, it's only for testing purposes.
