<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1>2.2.1. Video codecs</A></B></P>

<P>See <A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html">http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html</A> for the complete,
daily generated list!!!</P>

<P>The most important ones above all:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>MPEG1 (VCD) and MPEG2 (DVD) video</LI>
<LI>DivX ;-), OpenDivX (DivX4), DivX 5.00, 3ivX and other MPEG4 variants</LI>
<LI>Windows Media Video 7 (WMV1) and 8 (WMV2) used in .wmv files</LI>
<LI>Cinepak and Intel Indeo codecs (3.1,3.2,4.1,5.0)</LI>
<LI>MJPEG, AVID, VCR2, ASV2 and other hardware formats</LI>
<LI>VIVO 1.0, 2.0, I263 and other h263(+) variants</LI>
<LI>FLI/FLC</LI>
<LI>RealVideo 1.0</LI>
<LI>Various old simple RLE-like formats</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>If you have a Win32 codec not listed here, and not supported yet, just read the <A
HREF="#2.2.3">codec importing</A> to get info about how to help us adding support
for it!</P>

<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.1>2.2.1.1. DivX4/DivX5</A></B></P>

<P>This section contains information about the DivX4 codec of
<A HREF="http://www.projectmayo.com">ProjectMayo</A>. Their first available alpha version was the OpenDivX 4.0
alpha 47 and 48. Support for this was/is included in <B>MPlayer</B>, and built by
default. We used to use its postprocessing code to optionally enhance visual
quality of MPEG1/2 movies. Now we use our own.</P>

<P>The new generation of this codec can even decode movies made with the
infamous DivX codec! And it's not everything, it's MUCH faster than the
traditional Win32 DivX DLL's (note that libavcodec's decoder is EVEN FASTER,
so the usage of this codec is <B>DISCOURAGED</B> - you need it only for
encoding). See below for configuration. The only disadvantage of this codec is
that it's currently closed-source. :(</P>

<P>The codec can be downloaded from the following URL:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://avifile.sourceforge.net">http://avifile.sourceforge.net</A></P>

<P>If it doesn't work, try :</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://divx.com">http://divx.com</A></P>

<P>Unpack it, and run <CODE>./install.sh</CODE> as root.</P>

<P>Note: do NOT forget to add <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE> to your
<CODE>/etc/ld.so.conf</CODE> and running <CODE>ldconfig</CODE> !</P>

<P><B>MPlayer</B> autodetects if DivX4/DivX5 is (properly) installed, just
compile as usual. If it doesn't detect it, you didn't install it exactly as
above, and/or has messed up config (see last question of 5.1 section).</P>

<P>Using it is a bit tricky. As it conflicts with the old OpenDivX (its API is
very similar to OpenDivX's), OpenDivX code is disabled, and the OpenDivX
driver calls this library too.</P>

<P>Generally we can pinpoint this issue to that you have two options to use
this codec:</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=0>
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD VALIGN=top><FONT CLASS="text">-vc&nbsp;odivx</TD><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD><FONT CLASS="text">using the codec as a new version of OpenDivX.
in this case it produces YV12 image in its own buffer,
and <B>MPlayer</B> (libvo) does colorspace conversion. (<B>RECOMMENDED!</B>)</TD><TR>
<TD></TD><TD VALIGN=top><FONT CLASS="text">-vc&nbsp;divx4</TD><TD></TD>
<TD><FONT CLASS="text">using the codec's colorspace conversion.
in this mode, you can use YUY2/UYVY too.</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>The 'odivx' method is usually faster, due to the fact that it transfers
image data in YV12 (planar YUV 4:2:0) format, thus requiring much less
bandwidth on the bus. For packed YUV modes (YUY2, UYVY) use the 'divx4'
method. For RGB modes you can choose freely, their speed is same, maybe
differ according to the current bpp.</P>

<P>NOTE: If your -vo driver supports direct rendering, then -vc divx4 may be
faster, or even the fastest solution.</P>

<P>Note: it supports postprocessing too (use option <CODE>-pp</CODE> to
enable using it), but range of values is strange: </P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=0>

</TABLE></P>

<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.2>2.2.1.2. ffmpeg's DivX/libavcodec</A></B></P>

<P>Beginning with version 0.4.2 ,
<A HREF="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net">ffmpeg</A> contains an
<B>opensource</B> DivX codec, which is compatible with the traditional DivX.
<B>MPlayer</B> supports this codec, and this makes it possible to <B>watch
DivX/DivX4/DivX5 movies on non-x86 platforms</B>, and gain much faster
<B>DivX/DivX4/DivX5</B> decoding speed than the Win32 codecs and the original
DivX4 library has!</P>

<P>It also contains lots of nice codecs, such as RealVideo 1.0, MJPEG, h263,
h263+, etc.</P>

<P>If you use MPlayer

<UL>
  <LI>from release : then you have libavcodec right in the package, just
    build <B>MPlayer</B> as usual.</LI>
  <LI>from CVS : you have to download it manually directly from <B>FFmpeg</B>'s
    CVS tree (ffmpeg 0.4.5 version will NOT work with mplayer!):

<P><CODE>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ffmpeg.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ffmpeg login<BR>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ffmpeg.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ffmpeg co ffmpeg
</CODE></P>

<P>Note: <I>if you copy with CVS subdirs, next time it's enough to do
'cvs update'.</I></P>
<P>Now, move the newly downloaded ffmpeg source's <B>libavcodec</B> directory,
(with all it's subdirectories) to <B>MPlayer</B>'s tree, so it will look
like this:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>main/libavcodec</CODE></P>

<P>Symlinking is NOT enough, you have to copy/move it!!!</P>

  </LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>Then compile. configure detects if it's alright, and can be compiled. The
codec also <B>supports postprocessing!</B></P>

<P>In order to use it, update your codecs.conf file, and do as the manpage,
or the example.conf says (the -vfm option).</P>

<P>To achieve the <B>greatest speed</B> on my K6, I remove the
<CODE>ffmpeg12</CODE> section from codecs.conf (this codec isn't optimized, and
libmpeg2 is twice as fast), and place <CODE>vfm=5</CODE> in my config file.
Then <B>MPlayer</B> always uses <B>ffdivx/ffodivx</B> to decode
<B>DivX</B> files, and libmpeg2 for MPEG1/2 . With this and my
Matrox G400, I can view even the highest resolution DivX movies on my
K6/2 500, without framedrop.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.3>2.2.1.3.  XAnim codecs</A></B></P>

<P>Foreword:
Be advised that the XAnim binary codecs are packaged with a piece of text
claiming to be a legally binding software license which, among other
absurdities, forbids the user to use the codecs in conjunction with any
program other than XAnim. As the XAnim author has yet to bring legal
action against anyone for codec-related issues, the MPlayer developers
don't lose too much sleep over this and you probably shouldn't, either.
</P>

<P>So yes, <B>MPlayer</B> can use XAnim's codecs for decoding. It's very
easy to enable them:</P>

<P>
<UL>
  <LI>download the codecs you wish to use from the
  <A HREF="http://xanim.va.pubnix.com">XAnim site</A>. The <B>3ivx</B> codec
  isn't there, so download it from the <A HREF="http://www.3ivx.com">3ivx site</A>.</LI>

  <LI>use the <CODE>--with-xanimlibdir</CODE> option to tell configure where
  it can find the xanim codecs. By default, it checks them at
  <CODE>/usr/local/lib/xanim/mods, /usr/lib/xanim/mods and /usr/lib/xanim</CODE>.
  Alternatively you can set the environment variable <I>XANIM_MOD_DIR</I> to
  the dir of the XAnim codecs.</LI>

  <LI>rename/symlink the filenames by cutting out the architecture stuff, so they will
  have filenames like these : <CODE>vid_cvid.xa, vid_h263.xa, vid_iv50.xa</CODE>

</UL>
</P>

<P>They are video codec family number 10, so you may want to use <CODE>-vfm 10</CODE>
option to tell <B>MPlayer</B> to use them if possible.</P>

<P>Tested codecs are: <B>Indeo 3.2</B>, <B>4.1</B>, <B>5.0</B>, <B>CVID</B>, <B>3ivX</B>, <B>h263</B>.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.4>2.2.1.4.  VIVO video</A></B></P>

<P><B>MPlayer</B> can play Vivo (1.0 and 2.0) videos. The most suitable codec
for 1.0 files is FFmpeg's H263 decoder, you can use it with the <CODE>-vc
ffh263</CODE> option (default) (you'll need the newest libavcodec !). For 2.0 files, use
the <CODE>ivvideo.dll</CODE> Win32 DLL file (from <A
HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/samples/drivers32/ivvideo.dll">here</A>),
and install it under <CODE>/usr/lib/win32</CODE> or wherever you store the
Win32 codecs. This latter codec doesn't support YV12 nor YUY2 only BGR modes,
thus usable only with the X11 and OpenGL outputs. Hopefully ffh263 will support
VIVO 2.0 files in the future.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.5>2.2.1.5.  MPEG 1/2 video</A></B></P>

<P>MPEG1 and MPEG2 are decoded with the native library <B>libmpeg2</B>.
Its source code is included in <B>MPlayer</B>, and of course it is multiplatform.
We handle buggy MPEG 1/2 video files by catching sig11 (segmentation fault),
and quickly reinitializing the codec, and continue exactly from where the failure
did occur.
No speed decrease is measurable.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.6>2.2.1.6.  MS Video1</A></B></P>

<P>This is a very old and very bad codec of Microsoft. In the past it was
decoded with the <CODE>msvidc32.dll</CODE> Win32 codec, now we have our own
open-source implementation (by <A HREF="mailto:melanson@pcisys.net">Mike
Melanson</A>).</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.7>2.2.1.7.  Cinepak CVID</A></B></P>

<P><B>MPlayer</B> now has its own opensource, multiplatform Cinepak decoder.
Supports YUV outputs, thus hardware scaling if video output driver allows.
Used by default.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.8>2.2.1.8.  RealVideo</A></B></P>

<P>Currently ONLY the RealVideo 1.0 (fourcc RV10) codec is supported, through
ffmpeg. Sadly, no new RealMedia files come with this one, only with the newer
RV20 and RV30 codecs which are closed-source. Their future support is
unlikely :(</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.1.9>2.2.1.9.  XViD</A></B></P>

<P><B>XViD</B> is another development from good old OpenDivX (first
development was DivX4).</P>

<P><B>Advantages</B> :
  <UL>
    <LI>opensource</LI>
    <LI>its API is compatible with DivX4 so it's easy to add support for
      it</LI>
    <LI>2-pass encoding support</LI>
    <LI>nice encoding quality, higher speed than DivX4 (you can optimize it for
      your box while compiling)</LI>
  </UL>
</P>

<P><B>Disadvantages</B> :
  <UL>
    <LI>currently it doesn't properly <B>decode</B> all DivX/DivX4 files (but who cares, we can play them using libavcodec)</LI>
    <LI>you have to choose between DivX4 <B>OR</B> XViD support at
      compiletime</LI>
    <LI>under development</LI>
  </UL>
</P>

<P><B>Installation</B> : it's currently available only in CVS. Here are the
  downloading and installation instructions :<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xvid.org:/xvid
    login</CODE><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.xvid.org:/xvid co

  &nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>Edit Makefile.linux to fit your needs</CODE><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>make -f Makefile.linux</CODE><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Get encore2.h and decore.h from Divx4linux package, and copy them to <CODE>/usr/local/include/</CODE><BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>recompile <B>MPlayer</B> with
    --with-xvidcore=/path/to/libcore.a</CODE><BR>
</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.2>2.2.2.  Audio codecs</A></B></P>

<P>The most important audio codecs above all :<BR>
<UL>
<LI>MPEG layer 2, and layer 3 (MP3) audio (<B>native</B> code, with MMX/SSE/3DNow! optimization)</LI>
<LI>MPEG layer 1 audio (<B>native</B> code, with libavcodec)</LI>
<LI>AC3 Dolby audio (<B>native</B> code, with MMX/SSE/3DNow! optimization)</LI>
<LI>Ogg Vorbis audio codec (<B>native</B> lib)</LI>
<LI>Voxware audio (using DirectShow DLL)</LI>
<LI>alaw, msgsm, pcm and other simple old audio formats</LI>
<LI>VIVO audio (g723, Vivo Siren)</LI>
<LI>RealAudio: DNET (low bitrate AC3)</LI>
</UL></P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.2.1>2.2.2.1.  Software AC3 decoding</A></B></P>

<P>This is the default decoder used for files with AC3 audio.</P>

<P>The AC3 decoder can create output audio mixes for 2, 4, or 6
speakers.  When configured for 6 speakers, this decoder provides
separate output of all the AC3 channels to the soundcard driver,
allowing the full "surround sound" experience without the external AC3
decoder required to use the hwac3 codec.</P>

<P>Use the <CODE>-channels</CODE> option to select the number of output channels.
Use <CODE>-channels 2</CODE> for a stereo downmix.  For a 4 channel downmix (Left
Front, Right Front, Left Surround and Right Surround outputs), use
<CODE>-channels 4</CODE>.  In this case, any Centre channel will be mixed
equally to the front channels.  Lastly, "-channels 6" will output all the AC3
channels as they are encoded - in the order Left, Right, Left Surround, Right
Surround, Centre and LFE.</P>

<P>The default number of output channels is 2.</P>

<P>To use more than 2 output channels, you'll need to be using OSS,
and to have a soundcard driver that supports the appropriate number of
output channels via the SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS ioctl.  For example, a
version of the emu10k1 driver (used with the SB Live cards) newer than
August 2001 should be suitable (I heard newest ALSA CVS supports this too).</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.2.2>2.2.2.2.  Hardware AC3 decoding</A></B></P>

<P>You'll need an AC3 capable soundcard, with digital out (SP/DIF). The
card's driver must properly support the AFMT_AC3 format (like C-Media does).
Connect your AC3 decoder to the SP/DIF output, and use the '-ac hwac3'
option. It may or may not work (experimental). It will work with C-Media
cards, and with SB Live! + ALSA driver. It won't work with Live!'s OSS
driver!</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.2.3>2.2.2.3.  libmad support</A></B></P>

<P><A HREF="http://mad.sourceforge.net">libmad</A> is a multiplatform MPEG audio
decoding library. If you don't know why is it good, you probably don't need it.</P>

<P>It doesn't handle broken files well, and sometimes has problems with seeking.</P>

<P>To enable support, compile with the <CODE>--enable-mad</CODE> configure
option.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.2.4>2.2.2.4.  VIVO audio</A></B></P>

<P>The audio codec used in VIVO files depends on whether it's a VIVO/1.0 or
VIVO/2.0 file. VIVO/1.0 files have <B>g.723</B> audio, and VIVO/2.0 files
have <B>Vivo Siren</B>. Both is <U>supported</U>. You can grab the g.723/Siren
Win32 DLL from
<A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/samples/drivers32/vivog723.acm">here</A>,
then copy it into the <CODE>/usr/lib/win32</CODE> directory, or respectively.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.2.5>2.2.2.5.  RealAudio</A></B></P>

<P>Currently the only supported one is the DNET codec. Actually it's a
low-bitrate version of the well-known AC3 codec. It can be found either in
old and new RealMedia movies.</P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.3>2.2.3. Win32 codec importing howto</A></B></P>

<P><B><A NAME=2.2.3.1>2.2.3.1. VFW codecs</A></B></P>

<P>VfW (Video for Windows) is the old Video API for Windows. Its codecs have
the .DLL or (rarely) .DRV extension.
If <B>MPlayer</B> fails with your AVI:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>UNKNOWN video codec: HFYU (0x55594648)</CODE></P>

<P>It means your AVI is encoded with a codec which has the HFYU fourcc (HFYU =
HuffYUV codec, DIV3 = DivX Low Motion, etc...). Now that we know this, we'll
have to find out which DLL Windows loads in order to play this file. In our
case, the system.ini contains this (with many others):</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>VIDC.HFYU=huffyuv.dll</CODE></P>

<P>So we'll need the huffyuv.dll file. Note that the audio codecs are specified
with the MSACM prefix:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>msacm.l3acm=L3codeca.acm</CODE></P>


<P>This is the MP3 codec.
So, now we have all the info needed (fourcc, codec file, sample AVI), submit
your codec support request in mail, and upload these files to the FTP:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>ftp://ftp.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/[codecname]/</CODE></P>


<P><B><A NAME=2.2.3.2>2.2.3.2. DirectShow codecs</A></B></P>

<P>DirectShow is the newer Video API, which is even worse than its predecessor.
Things are harder with DirectShow, since
<UL>
<LI>system.ini doesn't contain the needed information, instead it's stored in
the registry :(
<LI>we'll need the GUID of the codec.
</UL></P>

<P>So let's search that goddamn registry..
<UL>
<LI>Start 'regedit'
<LI>press ctrl-f, disable the first two checkbox, and enable the third. Type
the fourcc of the codec. (for ex.: TM20)
<LI>you should see a field which contains the path and filename
(for ex. : C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TM20DEC.AX)
<LI>now that we have the file, we'll need the GUID. Try searching again, but
now we'll search for the codec's name, not the fourcc. Its name can be acquired
when Media Player is playing that file, by checking File/Properties/Advanced.
If not, bad luck ;) Try guessing.
(for ex. search for : TrueMotion)
<LI>if found (in registry), there should be a FriendlyName field, and a CLSID
field. Write down that 16 byte of CLSID, this is the GUID required by us.
</UL></P>

<P>NOTE: if searching fails, try to enable all the checkboxes.. you may have
false hits, but maybe you'll have the right, too...</P>
<P>NOTE: dump that M$ shit.</P>


<P>So, now we have all the info needed (fourcc, GUID, codec file, sample AVI),
submit your codec support request in mail, and upload these files to the FTP:<BR>
ftp://ftp.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/incoming/[codecname]/</P>
