## MPlayer config file
##
## This file can be copied to /etc/mplayer.conf and/or ~/.mplayer/config .
## If both exist, the ~/.mplayer/config's settings override the
## /etc/mplayer.conf ones. And, of course command line overrides all.
## The options are the same as in the command line, but they can be specified
## more flexibly here. See below.
##

vo=xv			# To specify your default video output see -vo help for
			# valid settings

fs=yes			# Enlarges movie window to your desktop's size.
			# Used by drivers: all

vm=no			# Tries to change to a different videomode
			# Used by drivers: dga2, x11, sdl

#bpp=0			# Force changing display depth.
			# Valid settings are: 0, 15, 16, 24, 32
			# may need 'vm=yes' too.
			# Used by drivers: fbdev, dga2, svga

zoom=no			# Enable software scaling (powerful CPU needed)
			# Used by drivers: svga

# x=800			# scale movie to <x> pixels width
# y=600			# scale movie to <y> pixels height
