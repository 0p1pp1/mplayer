## MPlayer config file
##
## This file can be copied to /etc/mplayer.conf and/or ~/.mplayer/config .
## If both exist, the ~/.mplayer/config's settings override the
## /etc/mplayer.conf ones. And, of course command line overrides all.
## The options are the same as in the command line, but they can be specified
## more flexibly here. See below.
##

vo=xv				# To specify your default video output
				# see -vo help for available options

fs=yes				# Turns on hardware scaling (where available)

vm=no				# Tries to change to a smaller videomode
				# (can be combined with -fs, but it doesn't
				# have point...)
				# Used by drivers: dga, x11 (, sdl?)

zoom=yes			# Turns on software scaling (where available)
				# Used by drivers: sdl, svga

##
## Multiple languages are available :)
##
## Hungarian	igen	nem
## English	yes	no
## German	ja	nein
## Spanish	si	no
## Binary	1	0
##
## You can also use spaces and/or tabs.
##

sound	= 1
nosound	= nein

##
## Remember the -noalsa switch ? You can specify it either with:
##
## noalsa = 1
## or
## alsa = no
## or
## noalsa = no
##

alsa = nem

ffactor = 0.75

##
## You can also include other configfiles
## Specify full path!
