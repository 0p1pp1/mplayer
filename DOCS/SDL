Here are some last minute notes about SDL out in IdegCounter
release of mplayer.

There are several commandline switches for sdl:
-sdl <name>	specifies sdl driver to use (ie. aalib,
		dga, x11)
-noxv		disables Xvideo hardware acceleration
-forcexv	tries to force Xvideo acceleration

SDL Keys:
F toggles fullscreen/windowed mode
C cycles available fullscreen modes
W/S mappings for * and / (mixer control)

Please report problems or bugs with sdl out to
