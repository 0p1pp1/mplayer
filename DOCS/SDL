Here are some notes about SDL out in MPlayer.

There are several commandline switches for sdl:
-sdl <name>	specifies sdl driver to use (ie. aalib,
		dga, x11)
-noxv		disables Xvideo hardware acceleration
-forcexv	tries to force Xvideo acceleration

SDL Keys:
F toggles fullscreen/windowed mode
C cycles available fullscreen modes
W/S mappings for * and / (mixer control)

KNOWN BUGS:
- Keys pressed under aalib console driver repeat forever.
  It's bug in SDL, I can't change it (tested with SDL 1.2.1).

Please report problems or bugs with sdl out to the MPlayer-users
mailinglist or directly to Felix Buenemann <atmosfear@users.sf.net>
