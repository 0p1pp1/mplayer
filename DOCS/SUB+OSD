SUBTITLES
---------
Yes, mplayer also supports many kinds of subtitles. Currently (2001/06/01)
7 kinds of subtitle can be used by the subreader code. To see what are
these subtitle formats, see subreader.c, line ~20.

Subtitles are displayed with a technique called 'OSD', On Screen Display.
OSD is used to display current time, volume bar, seek bar etc.


INSTALLING OSD and SUB
----------------------

You need an mplayer font package to be able to use OSD/SUB feature.
There are many ways to get it:

1. use the font generator tool at TOOLS/subfont-c
   It's a complete tool to convert from TTF/Type1/etc font to mplayer font pkg.
   (read TOOLS/subfont-c/README for details)

2. use the font generator GIMP plugin at TOOLS/subfont-GIMP
   (note: you must have HSI RAW plugin too, see URL below)

3. download ready-to-use font packages from mplayer site.
   Note: currently available fonts are only for limited iso 8859-1/2 support,
   and there is a few special version for korean, russian etc codepages.
   You'd better building font yourself with tool mentioned above.
   Font should have appropriate font.desc file which maps unicode font
   positions to the actual code page of the subtitles text. Other solution
   is to have subtitles encoded in utf8 encoding and use -utf8 option
   or just name the subtitles file <video_name>.utf and have it in the same
   dir as the video file. Recoding from different codepages to utf8 could be
   done by using konwert (debian) or iconv (RedHat) programs.


   some usefull URLs:
   ftp://ftp.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/releases/         - ISO fonts, OBSOLETED!
   ftp://ftp.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/contrib/fonts/    - various fonts by users
   http://realtime.ssu.ac.kr/~lethean/mplayer       - korean fonts & RAW plugin

After that, UNZIP the files to ~/.mplayer/font/
Now you have to see a clock at the upper left corner of the movie
(switch it off with 'o')

OSD has 3 states: (switch with 'o')
    - clock + volume bar + seek bar + sub     (default)
    - volume bar + seek bar + sub
    - only sub

You can change default behaviour by setting osdlevel= variable in config file.
