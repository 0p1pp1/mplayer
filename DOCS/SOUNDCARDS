Recommendations for misc. soundcards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SB Live!:
			OSS	: OK
			ALSA	: (untested)
			Max kHz : 48

Gravis UltraSound ACE:
			OSS     : default settings are OK
			ALSA    : if video lags, use OSS or mplayerHQ
			Max kHz : 48

Gravis UltraSound MAX:
			OSS     : use it if you wanna be sure, but
			ALSA    : has no known problems
			Max kHz : 48

ESS 688 and probably all old SB's:
			OSS     : OK
			ALSA    : OK
			Max kHz : 44.1

PC Speaker or DAC:
			OSS     : only with the new HQ timing code
			          (maybe won't work at all in the future)
			ALSA    : no driver
			Max kHz : 6 ;) (the driver emulates 44.1 maybe more)
			Driver  : ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp

 - MPlayer is mostly intended for OSS
 - use at least 2.4 if possible, 2.2 isn't tested
 - if sound clicks when playing from CD-ROM, turn on IRQ unmasking !
   for example "hdparm -u1 /dev/cdrom" (see "man hdparm" !!!)
 - don't use your soundcard by other application ( for ex. XMMS ) !
   if you use ESD, start MPlayer with the esddsp utility !
