Recommendations for misc. soundcards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aureal Vortex 2:
			run ./configure script with --disable-select option

GUS PnP:
			OSS	: none
			ALSA	: see Aureal Vortex2
			Max kHz	: 48

SB Live!:
			OSS	: OK
			ALSA	: (?)
			Max kHz : 48

Gravis UltraSound ACE:
			OSS     : sucks, max 44Khz !
			ALSA    : if video lags, use OSS
			Max kHz : 48

Gravis UltraSound MAX:
			OSS     : OK
			ALSA    : OK (?)
			Max kHz : 48

ESS 688 and probably all old SB's (without buffers):
			OSS     : OK (48Khz, somehow...)
			ALSA    : OK
			Max kHz : 44.1

PC Speaker or DAC:
			OSS     : only with the new HQ timing code
			          (maybe won't work at all in the future)
			ALSA    : no driver
			Max kHz : 6 ;) (the driver emulates 44.1 maybe more)
			Driver  : ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/pcsp

 - MPlayer is mostly intended for OSS
 - use at least 2.4 if possible, 2.2 isn't tested
 - In case of any problems, first try recompiling with
   ./configure --disable-select , then make distclean ; make .
   Your soundcard may not support querying of its buffer.
 - if sound clicks when playing from CD-ROM, turn on IRQ unmasking !
   for example "hdparm -u1 /dev/cdrom" (see "man hdparm" !!!)
   This is recommended anyways... (for XMMS, etc...)
 - don't use your soundcard by other application ( for ex. XMMS ) !
   if you use ESD, start MPlayer with the esddsp utility !
 - Please tell us how MPlayer and your soundcard(s) worked together!
