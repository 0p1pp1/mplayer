Videocards with hardware acceleration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* read DOCS/MTRR too!

  "Hardware acceleration" usually means hardware YUV conversion, scaling,
bilinear filtering. Under Linux and XFree86, this is done by the XVideo
extension, this is what the option '-vo xv' uses.
  In order to make this work, be sure to check the following:
1. your card actually supports harware acceleration
2. you use XFree86 4.0.2 or newer (former versions don't have XVideo)
3. X loads the XVideo extension, it's something like this:
   (II) Loading extension XVideo
   in /var/log/XFree86.0.log
   NOTE : this loads only the XFree86 support. In a good install, this is
          always loaded, and doesn't mean that the _card's_ XVideo support is
          loaded!
4. The XVideo extensions can use your card. Try 'xvinfo' which is the part of
   the XFree86 distribution. It should display a long text, similar to this:

	X-Video Extension version 2.2
	screen #0
	  Adaptor #0: "Savage Streams Engine"
	    number of ports: 1
	    port base: 43
	    operations supported: PutImage 
	    supported visuals:
	      depth 16, visualID 0x22
	      depth 16, visualID 0x23
	    number of attributes: 5
	(...etc...)
5. Be sure MPlayer is compiled with the "xv" target. "./configure" should say:
	Checking for Xv ... yes
6. If all is fine, try the option '-vo xv' . It should work.
   (if it doesn't, send us a bugreport. See the README on how to do this.)



  There are additional drivers for the Matrox cards, which are usually
better than XVideo, consume much less CPU, and some doesn't even need X.
(Arpi please complete this section somewhat :) I'll correct your english:)



  If your card lacks hardware acceleration, you can still boost your fps by
using the DGA driver.
1. Make sure X loads the DGA extension:
	(II) Loading extension XFree86-DGA
2. MPlayer's DGA driver is autodetected on ./configure, or you can force it
   with --enable-dga.
3. Be sure to use 24/32bpp mode, since there is no converter right now.. :(
4. Install MPlayer SUID root.
   (see the FAQ on how to do this, and... heed the warning!)
5. Use '-vo dga' option, and there you go! (hope so:)
