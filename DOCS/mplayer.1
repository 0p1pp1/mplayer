.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mplayer
Yes. Yet another movie player for linux.
What is the special with this? It works, at least for me :)
I've tried lots of players under linux (mtv,xmps,dvdview,livid/oms,VideoLAN,
xine,xanim,avifile,xmmp) but they all have some problem. Mostly with
special files or with audio/video sync. Most of them is unable to play
both mpeg1, mpeg2 and avi (DivX) files. Many players have image quality
or speed problems too. So I've decided to write/modify one...
.LP
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
MPlayer works out-of-the-box, so you generally don't have to mess with
any options.
.TP
.I NOTE
Every "flag" option has "noflag" pair, e.g. -fs opposite is -nofs
.TP
.B \-dvd\ titleid
tell MPlayer which movies (marked with titleid) to play. For example
sometimes '1' are trailers, and '2' is the real movie.
.TP
.B \-chapter\ chapterid
specify which chapter to start playing at. Examples can be found below.
.TP
.B \-dvdangle\ angleid
some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.
Here you can tell MPlayer which angels to use. Examples can be found below.
.TP
.B \-vo\ <driver>[:<device>]
select video output driver and optinaly device. "device" is valid with
SDL and GGI too, it means sub-driver then (for example: -vo sdl:aalib).

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -vo help

.TP
.B \-ao\ <driver>[:<device>]
select audio output driver and optinaly device. "device" is valid with
SDL and GGI too, it means sub-driver then (for example: -vo sdl:esd).

If using OSS, you can specify which sound device to use like this :
-ao oss:/dev/dsp1     (replaces the old -dsp option)

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -ao help

.TP
.B \-vcd\ track
play video cd track from device instead of plain file
.TP
.B \-nosound
don't play sound
.TP
.B \-fs
fullscreen playing (centers movie, and makes black
bands around it)
.TP
.B \-vm
use XF86VidMode extension for mode changing
.TP
.B \-zoom
use software scaling, where available (use with -nofs)
.TP
.B \-x\ x
scale image to x width [if driver suppports!]
.TP
.B \-y\ y
scale image to y height
.TP
.B \-xy\ factor
scale image by <factor>
.TP
.B \-pp\ quality
apply postprocess filter on decoded image.
You need a STRONG CPU in order to use this!
The supported formats and settings are:

        MPEG 1/2   0 (none), 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        OpenDivX   0 (none), 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63
        DivX4      0 (none) - 60
        DivX       0 (none), 1, 2, 3, 4

.I NOTE
Maybe less/more.
.TP
.B \-autoq\ quality
dynamically changes the level of postprocess, depending on spare CPU
time available. Uses the same value ranges as -pp . The number you
specify will be the maximum level used. Usually you can use some big
number. You don't have to (and don't) use together with -pp !
.TP
.B \-ffactor\ number
resample alphamap of the font. Can be:

        0    plain white fonts
        0.75 very narrow black outline [default]
        1    narrow black outline
        10   bold black outline
.TP
.B \-sub\ file
use/display this subtitle file
.TP
.B \-subfps\ rate
specify frame/sec rate of subtitle file
(ONLY for frame-based SUB files, i.e. NOT MicroDVD format!)
(default: the same as the movie)
.TP
.B \-subdelay\ sec
delays subtitles by <sec> seconds. Can be negative.
.TP
.B \-osdlevel\ level
specifies which mode the OSD should start in (0 : none, 1 : seek, 2: seek+timer)
(default = 2)
.TP
.B \-lircconf\ configfile
specifies a configfile for LIRC (see http://www.lirc.org) if you don't like the default ~/.lircrc 
.TP
.B \-v
enable verbose output (more -v means more verbose)
.TP
.B \-quiet
display less output, status messages.
.TP
.B \-benchmark
used in combination with -nosound and -vo null for benchmarking.
.TP
.B \-skin skin directory
load skin from this directory. For example '-skin fittyfene' tries these :

    /usr/local/share/mplayer/Skin/fittyfene
    ~/.mplayer/Skin/fittyfene
.IP
.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
These options can help you solve your particular problem.. Also, see the
documentation !
.TP
.B \-vc <name>
force usage of a specific video codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example :

    -vc divx       use VFW DivX codec
    -vc divxds     use DirectShow DivX codec
    -vc ffdivx     use libavcodec's DivX codec
    -vc ffmpeg12   use libavcodec's MPEG1/2 codec
    -vc divx4      use ProjectMayo's DivX codec
.TP
.B \-ac <name>
force usage of a specific audio codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example :

    -ac mp3        use libmp3 MP3 codec
    -ac mp3acm     use l3codeca.acm MP3 codec
    -ac ac3        use AC3 codec
    -ac hwac3      enable Hardware AC3 passthrough
                   (see documentation)
    -ac vorbis     use libvorbis
.TP
.B \-vfm <1-5>
force usage of a specific codec FAMILY, and FALLBACK to default if failed.
For example:

    -vfm 2         use VFW (Win32) codecs
    -vfm 3         use OpenDivX/DivX4 codec (YV12)
                   (same as -vc odivx but fallback)
    -vfm 4         use DirectShow (Win32) codecs
    -vfm 5         use libavcodec codecs
    -vfm 7         use DivX4 codec (YUY2)
                   (same as -vc divx4 but fallback)

NOTE : if libdivxdecore support was compiled in, then type 3 and 7 now contains
just the same DivX4 codec, but different APIs to reach it. For difference
between them and when to use which, check the DivX4 section in the
documentation.
.TP
.B \-afm <1-5>
force usage of a specific audio format. For example:

    -afm 1         use libmp3 (mp2/mp3,

    -afm 2         suppose raw PCM audio
    -afm 3         use libac3
    -afm 4         use a matching Win32 codec
    -afm 5         use aLaw/uLaw driver
    -afm 10        use libvorbis
