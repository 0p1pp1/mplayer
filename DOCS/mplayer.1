.SH DESCRIPTION
.I mplayer
MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and non-x86
CPUs, see section 6). It plays most MPEG, AVI, MOV/QT and ASF/WMV files, supported by
many native and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, and even
DivX movies too (and you don't need the avifile library at all!).

Another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers :
X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, GGI, SDL (and all the drivers
they support), VESA (on every VESA compatible card, even without X!), and some
lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox, 3Dfx and Radeon) too! Most of them
supports software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.

Several subtitles types are supported (curently 9 !) and the fonts are
rendered with nice big antialiased shaded fonts ! Of course there is support
for european/ISO 8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic, korean
fonts.
.LP
.SH "GUI OPTIONS"
.I NOTE:
The GUI code has to be compiled in *explicitly*, for details see the
documentation.
.TP
.B \-gui
start MPlayer in GUI mode.
.TP
.B \-skin <skin\ directory>
load skin from this directory (WITHOUT path name!). For example '-skin fittyfene' tries these :

    /usr/local/share/mplayer/Skin/fittyfene
    ~/.mplayer/Skin/fittyfene
.LP
.SH "DVD OPTIONS"
.I NOTE:
These options are valid only with DVD support compiled in. For details,
see the documentation.
.TP
.B \-dvd\ titleid
tell MPlayer which movies (marked with titleid) to play. For example
sometimes '1' are trailers, and '2' is the real movie.
.TP
.B \-chapter\ <chapter\ id>
specify which chapter to start playing at. Examples can be found below.
.TP
.B \-dvdangle\ <angle\ id>
some DVD discs contain scenes that can be viewed from multiple angles.
Here you can tell MPlayer which angles to use. Examples can be found below.
.TP
.B \-alang\ <audio\ stream\ language>
Used when playing DVD disks. Expects a two-letter country code(s) as
parameter, and always tries to play back audio streams those language
matches the given code. For example: -alang hu,en will always try to play
hungarian or if it's non-existant then english audio streams if there are any.
.TP
.B \-slang\ <subtitle\ language>
See the -sid option, but this one needs a two-letter parameter, a country code.
Like: -slang hu,en will always select hungarian or if it's non existant then
english subtitles, if there are any. For the list of available subtitles, use
with the -v switch and look at the output.
.TP
.B \-sid\ <id>
Turns on DVD subtitle displaying. Also, you MUST specify a number which
corresponds to a DVD subtitle language (0-31). For the list of available
subtitles, use with the -v switch and look at the output.
.LP
.SH "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
Every "flag" option has "noflag" pair, e.g. -fs opposite is -nofs
.TP
.B \-vo\ <driver>[:<device>]
select video output driver and optinaly device. "device" is valid with
SDL and GGI too, it means sub-driver then (for example: -vo sdl:aalib).

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -vo help

.TP
.B \-ao\ <driver>[:<device>]
select audio output driver and optinaly device. "device" is valid with
SDL too, it means sub-driver then (for example: -vo sdl:esd).

If using OSS, you can specify which sound device to use like this :
-ao oss:/dev/dsp1     (replaces the old -dsp option)

you can get the list of available drivers executing
.I mplayer -ao help

.TP
.B \-vcd\ <track>
play video cd track from device instead of plain file
.TP
.B \-nosound
don't play sound
.TP
.B \-fs
fullscreen playing (centers movie, and makes black
bands around it)
.TP
.B \-vm
try to change to a different video mode. dga2, x11 (XF86VidMode) and sdl
output drivers support it.
.TP
.B \-zoom
use software scaling, where available (use with -nofs). svga, x11, vesa
output drivers support it.
.TP
.B \-flip
flip image (useful for example for old Indeo codecs). Supported only(?)
by the 'sdl' and 'x11' outputs.
.TP
.B \-x\ <x>
scale image to x width (if driver suppports)
.TP
.B \-y\ <y>
scale image to y height (if driver supports)
.TP
.B \-sws\ <software\ scaler\ type>
this option sets the quality (and speed, respectively) of the software scaler,
with the -zoom option. For example with x11 or other outputs which lack
hardware acceleration. Possible settings are :

    0 - fast bilinear (default)
    1 - bilinear
    2 - bicubic (best quality)
.TP
.B \-xy\ <factor>
scale image by <factor>
.TP
.B \-autoq\ <quality>
dynamically changes the level of postprocess, depending on spare CPU
time available. Uses the same value ranges as -pp . The number you
specify will be the maximum level used. Usually you can use some big
number. You don't have to (and don't) use together with -pp !
.TP
.B \-ffactor\ <number>
resample alphamap of the font. Can be:

        0    plain white fonts
        0.75 very narrow black outline [default]

(ONLY for frame-based SUB files, i.e. NOT MicroDVD format!)
(default: the same fps as the movie)
.TP
.B \-subdelay\ <sec>
delays subtitles by <sec> seconds. Can be negative.
.TP
.B \-vobsub\ <vobsub\ file\ without\ extention>
specify the VobSub files that are to be used for subtitle.  This is
the full pathname without extensions, i.e. without the ".idx", ".ifo"
or ".sub".
.TP
.B \-vobsubid\ <vobsub\ subtitle\ id>
specify the VobSub subtitle id.  Valid values range from 0 to 31.
.TP
.B \-osdlevel\ <level>
specifies which mode the OSD should start in (0 : none, 1 : seek, 2: seek+timer)
(default = 2)
.TP
.B \-lircconf\ <config\ file>
specifies a configfile for LIRC (see http://www.lirc.org) if you don't like the default ~/.lircrc
.TP
.B \-v

.TP
.B \-quiet
display less output, status messages.
.TP
.B \-benchmark
used in combination with -nosound and -vo null for benchmarking.
.TP

.IP
.SH "ADVANCED OPTIONS"
.TP
.I NOTE
These options can help you solve your particular problem.. Also, see the
documentation !
.TP
.B \-vc <name>
force usage of a specific video codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example :

    -vc divx       use VFW DivX codec
    -vc divxds     use DirectShow DivX codec
    -vc ffdivx     use libavcodec's DivX codec
    -vc ffmpeg12   use libavcodec's MPEG1/2 codec
    -vc divx4      use ProjectMayo's DivX codec

See '-vc help' for FULL list !
.TP
.B \-ac <name>
force usage of a specific audio codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example :

    -ac mp3        use libmp3 MP3 codec
    -ac mp3acm     use l3codeca.acm MP3 codec
    -ac ac3        use AC3 codec
    -ac hwac3      enable Hardware AC3 passthrough
                   (see documentation)
    -ac vorbis     use libvorbis
    -ac ffmp3      use ffmpeg's MP3 decoder (SLOW)

See '-ac help' for FULL list !
.TP
.B \-vfm <1-12>
force usage of a specific codec FAMILY, and FALLBACK to default if failed.
For example:

    -vfm 2         use VFW (Win32) codecs
    -vfm 3         use OpenDivX/DivX4 codec (YV12)
                   (same as -vc odivx but fallback)
    -vfm 4         use DirectShow (Win32) codecs
    -vfm 5         use libavcodec codecs
    -vfm 7         use DivX4 codec (YUY2)
                   (same as -vc divx4 but fallback)
    -vfm 10        use XAnim codecs

See -vc help for FULL list !

.I NOTE:
if libdivxdecore support was compiled in, then type 3 and 7 now contains
just the same DivX4 codec, but different APIs to reach it. For difference
between them and when to use which, check the DivX4 section in the
documentation.
.TP
.B \-afm <1-12>
force usage of a specific audio format. For example:

    -afm 1         use libmp3 (mp2/mp3, but not mp1)
    -afm 2         suppose raw PCM audio
    -afm 3         use libac3
    -afm 4         use a matching Win32 codec
    -afm 5         use aLaw/uLaw driver
    -afm 10        use libvorbis
    -afm 11        use ffmpeg's MP3 decoder (even mp1)

See -ac help for FULL list !
.TP
.B \-sb\ <byte\ position>
seek to byte position
.TP
.B \-bpp\ <depth>
use different color depth than autodetect. Not all -vo drivers support
it (fbdev, dga2, svga, vesa).
.TP
.B \-pp\ <quality>
apply postprocess filter on decoded image.
Postprocessing effect depends on the codec and works only for MPEG1/2,
libavcodec codecs (ff*). It doesn't work for Win32/XAnim codecs.
Quality is an hexadecimal number built as below:

0x 00 TX hv YZ
      ^^ ^^ ^^
      ||  | ||
      ||  | |\- postprocessing flag for luminance:
      ||  | |   1/2: v/h deblock  4: dering
      ||  | |   8: auto contrast/brightness correction
      ||  | |
      ||  | \-- postproc flags for color:
      ||  |     1/2: v/h deblock  4: dering
      ||  |
      ||  \---- experimental deblocking filters:
      ||        11: X's filter 22: x1 filter
      ||
      |\------- deinterlacing modes
      |         1: linear interpolation  2: linear blend
      |         4: cubic interpolation   8: median
      |
      \-------- temporal denoise filter: 1 enabled
	
.I HINT:
0x2007f or 0x7f are known to give good results.
.I NOTE:
0x20000 (deinterlacing) may be required for DVD playback 
.TP
.B \-npp\ <options> (EXPERIMENTAL)
This option allows to give more litterate options for postprocessing, and is
another way of calling it (not with -pp).

.I EXAMPLE:
    '-pp 0x2007f' <=> '-npp hb,vb,dr,al,lb'
    '-pp 0x7f'    <=> '-npp hb,vb,dr,al'

The options for -npp are a coma separated list of the keywords below:
    de or default        : hdeblock:a,vdeblock:a,
                           dering:a,autolevels,tmpnoise:a:150:200:400 (0xTODO)
    fa or fast           : x1hdeblock:a,x1vdeblock:a,
                           dering:a,autolevels,tmpnoise:a:150:200:400 (0xTODO)
    hb or hdeblock       : horizontal deblocking filter (0xTODO)
    vb or vdeblock       : vertical deblocking filter (0xTODO)
    hr or rkhdeblock     : rk horizontal deblock filter (0xTODO)
    vr or rkvdeblock     : rk vertical deblock filter (0xTODO)
    h1 or x1hdeblock     : x1 horizontal deblock filter (0xTODO)
    v1 or x1vdeblock     : y1 horizontal deblock filter (0xTODO)
    dr or dering         : TODO
    al or autolevels     : brightness/contrast correction (0xTODO)
    lb or linblenddeint  : linear blend deinterlacing (0x20000)
    li or linipoldeint   : linear interpolation deinterlacing (0x10000)
    ci or cubicipoldeint : cubic interpolation deinterlacing (0x40000)
    md or mediandeint    : median deinterlacing (0x80000)
    tn or tmpnoise       : temporal denoise filter (0x100000)

These keywords accept a '-' prefix to disable the option.

.I EXAMPLE:
    '-npp de,-al' means 'default filters without brightness/contrast correction'

A postfix letter, separated by ':' may be appended to the option to indicate
its scope:
    a : automatically switches the filter off if the cpu is too slow
    c : do chrominance filtering too
    y : do not do chrominance filtering (that is only luminance filtering)

Each filter defaults to 'c' (chrominance).

.I EXAMPLE:
    '-npp de,tn:1:2:3' means 'enable default filters & temporal denoiser'
    '-npp hb:y,vb:a -autoq 6' means 'deblock horizontal only luminance, and
    automatically switch vertical deblocking on/off depending on available 
    cpu time'

.I HINT:
    the following values are known to give good results:
    -npp default -autoq 6 and -npp tn:150:200:400 for the denoiser

.TP
.B \-slave
