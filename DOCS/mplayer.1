.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B mplayer
is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and non\-x86
CPUs, see section 6). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, VIVO, ASF/WMV, QT/MOV, FLI,
RM, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ files, supported by many native, XAnim, and
Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, DivX 3/4/5 and even WMV movies too
(and you don't need the avifile library at all!).

Another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers.
It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, AAlib, DirectFB, but you can use
GGI and SDL (and this way all their drivers) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers
(for Matrox G-series, 3Dfx Banshee/Voodoo3 and ATI cards) too!
.br
Most of them supports software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
MPlayer supports displaying through some hardware MPEG decoder boards, such as the Siemens DVB and
DXR3/Hollywood+!

Nice big antialiased shaded subtitles with european/ISO 8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, 
etc), cyrillic, korean fonts are supported (10 supported subtitle formats: MicroDVD, SubRip, 
SubViewer, SAMI (smi), vplayer, RealMedia RT, ssa (Sub Station Alpha), AQT, VobSub, and our 
own: MPsub).

.SH "GUI OPTIONS"
.I NOTE:
The GUI code has to be compiled in *explicitly* (see documentation).
.br
.I NOTE:
The GUI code is STILL exterimental, it is under heavy development, parts of it (for example: playlist) not yet implemented.
.TP 
.B \-gui
Start MPlayer in GUI mode.
.TP 
.B \-skin <skin\ directory>

.br
.I NOTE:
Use \-slang to define the subtitle language by name.
.TP 
.B \-skipopening
Skip dvd opening (dvdnav only).
.TP 
.B \-slang\ <subtitle\ language>
See the \-sid option, but this one needs a two\-letter parameter, a country code.

.TP
.B \-hardframedrop
More intense frame dropping (breaks decoding). Leads to image disortion!
.TP 
.B \-hr\-mp3\-seek
Hi\-res mp3 seeking. Default is: enabled when playing from external MP3 file, as
we need to seek to the very exact position to keep A/V sync. It can be slow
especially when seeking backwards \- it has to rewind to the beginning to find
the exact frame.
.TP
.B \-hue <\-1000\ \-\ 1000>
Adjust hue of video signal (default 0). You can get colored negative

        ar\-delay    delay in msec before we start
                    to autorepeat a key
                    (0 to disable)
        ar\-rate     how many keypress/second when
                    we autorepeat
        keylist     prints all keys that can be
                    bound to

                    be bound

.I NOTE:
Autorepeat is currently only supported by joysticks.
.TP 
.B \-mc\ <seconds/frame>
Maximum A-V sync correction per frame (in seconds)

.TP 
.B \-monitor_vfreq <vertical frequency range>  (FBdev only)
.TP 
.B \-ni
Force usage of non\-interleaved AVI parser (fixes playing
of some bad AVI files).
.TP 
.B \-nobps
Don't use avg. byte/sec value for A\-V sync (AVI). Helps with some AVI files with broken header.
.TP 
.B \-double
enables doublebuffering. Fixes flicker by storing two frames in memory, and
displaying one while decoding another. Can effect OSD. Needs twice the memory
than a single buffer, so it won't work on cards with very few video memory.
.TP 
.B \-nojoystick
Turns off joystick support. Default is on, if compiled in.
.TP 
.B \-nolirc
Turns off lirc support.
.TP
.B \-nortc
Turns off usage of /dev/rtc (real-time clock)
.TP
.B \-noslices
Disable the use of draw_slice by codecs.
.TP
.B \-nowaveheader  (-ao pcm only)
Don't include wave header. Used for RAW PCM.
.TP 
.B \-npp\ <options>
This option allows to give more litterate options for postprocessing, 
and is another way of calling it (not with \-pp).

.I EXAMPLE:
    '\-pp 0x2007f' <=> '\-npp hb,vb,dr,al,lb'
    '\-pp 0x7f'    <=> '\-npp hb,vb,dr,al'

The options for \-npp are a coma separated list you can get by executing
.I mplayer \-npp help
.br
These keywords accept a '\-' prefix to disable the option.

.I EXAMPLE:
    '\-npp de,\-al' means 'default filters without brightness/contrast correction'

A ':' followed by a letter may be appended to the option to indicate its 
scope:
    a : automatically switches the filter off if the cpu is too slow
    c : do chrominance filtering too
    y : do not do chrominance filtering (that is only luminance filtering)

Each filter defaults to 'c' (chrominance).

.I EXAMPLE:
    '\-npp de,tn:1:2:3' means 'enable default filters & temporal denoiser'
    '\-npp hb:y,vb:a \-autoq 6' means 'deblock horizontal only luminance, and
    automatically switch vertical deblocking on/off depending on available 
    cpu time'
.TP 
.B \-pp\ <quality> (see \-npp option too!)
Apply postprocess filter on decoded image

Postprocessing effect depends on the codec and works only for MPEG1/2,
libavcodec codecs (ff*). It doesn't work for Win32/XAnim codecs.

This is the numerical mode to use postprocessing. The '\-npp' option described
below has the same effects but with letters. To have several filters at the
same time, simply add the hexadecimal values.

.I EXAMPLE:
The following values are known to give good results:
    \-pp 0x20000 <=> \-npp lb (deinterlacing \- for DVD/MPEG2 playback e.g.)
    \-pp 0x7f    <=> \-npp hb,vb,dr,al (smooth the images)
.TP
.B \-red_intensity <\-1000\ \-\ 1000>
Adjust intensity of red component of video signal (default 0).
.TP
.B \-saturation <\-1000\ \-\ 1000>
Adjust saturation of video output (default 0). You can get grayscale output 
with this option.
.TP 
.B \-sb\ <byte\ position> (see \-ss option too!)
Seek to byte position. Useful for playback from cdrom images / vob files with junk at the beginning.
.TP 
.B \-screenw\ <pixels> \-screenh\ <pixels>
If you use an output driver which can't know the resolution of the screen
(fbdev/x11 and/or TVout) this is where you can specify the horizontal and vertical
resolution.
.TP 
.B \-slave
This option switches on slave mode. This is intended for use
of MPlayer as a backend to other programs. Instead of intercepting keyboard
events, MPlayer will read simplistic command lines from its stdin.
See section
.B SLAVE MODE PROTOCOL
For the syntax.
.TP 
.B \-softsleep
Uses high quality software timers. Efficient as the RTC, doesn't need root,
but requires more CPU.
.TP 
.B \-srate <Hz>
Specifies Hz to playback audio on. Has effect on playback speed!
.TP 
.B \-stereo <mode>
Select type of MP2/MP3 stereo output.

        Stereo         0
        Left channel   1
        Right channel  2
.TP 
.B \-subcp\ codepage
If your system supports iconv(3), you can use this option to
specify codepage of the subtitle. Examples:

        \-subcp latin2
        \-subcp cp1250
.TP 
.B \-unicode
Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as UNICODE.
.TP 
.B \-utf8
Tells MPlayer to handle the subtitle file as UTF8.
.TP 
.B \-vc <name>
Force usage of a specific video codec, according to its name in codecs.conf,
for example:

    \-vc divx       use VFW DivX codec
    \-vc divxds     use DirectShow DivX codec
    \-vc ffdivx     use libavcodec's DivX codec
    \-vc ffmpeg12   use libavcodec's MPEG1/2 codec
    \-vc divx4      use ProjectMayo's DivX codec

See '\-vc help' for FULL list!
