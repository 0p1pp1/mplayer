<B>Question:</B> What is the problem with GCC 2.96 ? And with 3.x ?
</P>

<P>
<B>Answer:</B>
</P>

<P>
And for the people, who periodically asks what are the exact problems with
gcc 2.96, my answer: <I>we don't know.</I> We just see various bugreports mostly
gcc internal bugs, compiler syntax errors in source or bad code compiled. They
all are solved using different version of gcc. I understand that gcc 2.96
has different default optimization flags and they conflicts with our inline
asm code, but we can't fix them, and we really don't want to fix them as they
work with other compilers or gcc versions, and the fix may cause speed loss.
</P>

<P>
I think that the gcc 2.96 should be fixed to be option-compatible with other
releases, but redhat guys refused to do it. If someone interested - ask
Eugene K., avifile author, he has a long mailing with them, because they had
the same problems with avifile. Finally he changed avifile source to
<I>workaround</I> gcc 2.96 bugs...
We simply has no interest and time to do it.
</P>

<P>
Ah, and about the pipe-in-comment bug: it wasn't really our bug.
I've talked one of gcc maintainers, and he told me that gcc 2.96 and 3.x
supports intel asm syntax, and it caused the pipe bug. But it was a bug,
because gcc silently, without any warning, ignored the whole asm block.
*They* have fixed that, now it prints warning and doesn't skip the block.
(at least he told me, i didn't checked)
</P>

<P>
Other gcc 3.x problems comes from broken libstdc++ or glibc header (std_*.h)
installation. They are not our fault. MPlayer compiles and works well with
gcc 3.x versions. <B>Only 2.96 is broken</B>, but it depends on many environment
elements, including gcc 2.96 release number, enabled mplayer features, etc.
<I>If it works for you using gcc 2.96, it doesn't mean it will work for everyone.</I>
