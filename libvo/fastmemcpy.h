/*
 This part of code was taken by from Linux-2.4.3 and slightly modified
for MMX, MMX2, SSE instruction set. I have done it since linux uses page aligned
blocks but mplayer uses weakly ordered data and original sources can not
speedup them. Only using PREFETCHNTA and MOVNTQ together have effect!

>From IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual Volume 1,

Order Number 245470:
"10.4.6. Cacheability Control, Prefetch, and Memory Ordering Instructions"

Data referenced by a program can be temporal (data will be used again) or
non-temporal (data will be referenced once and not reused in the immediate
future). To make efficient use of the processor's caches, it is generally
desirable to cache temporal data and not cache non-temporal data. Overloading
the processor's caches with non-temporal data is sometimes referred to as
"polluting the caches".
The non-temporal data is written to memory with Write-Combining semantics.

The PREFETCHh instructions permits a program to load data into the processor
at a suggested cache level, so that it is closer to the processors load and
store unit when it is needed. If the data is already present in a level of
the cache hierarchy that is closer to the processor, the PREFETCHh instruction
will not result in any data movement.
But we should you PREFETCHNTA: Non-temporal data fetch data into location
close to the processor, minimizing cache pollution.

The MOVNTQ (store quadword using non-temporal hint) instruction stores
packed integer data from an MMX register to memory, using a non-temporal hint.
The MOVNTPS (store packed single-precision floating-point values using
non-temporal hint) instruction stores packed floating-point data from an
XMM register to memory, using a non-temporal hint.

The SFENCE (Store Fence) instruction controls write ordering by creating a
fence for memory store operations. This instruction guarantees that the results
of every store instruction that precedes the store fence in program order is
globally visible before any store instruction that follows the fence. The
SFENCE instruction provides an efficient way of ensuring ordering between
procedures that produce weakly-ordered data and procedures that consume that
data.
