	framebuffer driver for ATI Radeon chipset video boards
	======================================================

These files are replacement for linux-2.4.x-ac.y drivers.
To use this driver you should have at least linux-2.4.5-ac.1
then simply replace linux/drivers/video/radeon* with files
from this directory.
Note: since linux-2.4.10 this driver was moved from -ac to
Linus distribution.

Alternative way:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simply type two commands in this directory:
make
make install

Anyway you should have 'Frame buffer support' compiled into linux-kernel
and at least '8bpp packed pixel support' compiled and installed as module.  
(But if you plan to use this module with mplayer you also should have
16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp pixel support compiled as modules).  


                      Radeon video overlay
		      ====================
		      
Was designed for mplayer and currently can be used only by mplayer.
It's RGB-YUV BES for radeon cards (althrough there is experimental
support for rage128 / rage128pro chips).

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simply type two commands in this directory:
make
make install
If you install it first time then type also:
make nodes

Using with mplayer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently there is only way to use ATI's drivers:
mplayer -vo vesa:lvo:/dev/radeon_vid -<your vesa's options> filename
or
mplayer -vo vesa:lvo:/dev/rage128_vid -<your vesa's options> filename

For YV12 formats you can use also:
mplayer -vo mga:/dev/radeon_vid -<your mga's option> filename

but in this case you should load at least radeonfb driver from
this package.

Configuring:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can tune up some parameters with using following trick:
echo "parameter=value">/dev/radeon_vid
Example (disables adaptive deinterlacing):
echo "deinterlace=off">/dev/radeon_vid

To know more about these parameters - try read /dev/radeon_vid file ;)
For example:
cat /dev/radeon_vid

List of parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
brightness=decval          (-64:+63) doesn't work on radeons
saturation=decval          (0:+31) doesn't work on radeons
double_buff=on/off         enables/disables double buffering
colour_key=hexval          defines colour key
deinterlace=on/off         enables/disables adaprive deinterlacing
deinterlace_pattern=hexval defines deinterlacing pattern

Driver parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use some additional parameters during module loading:
Example:
modprobe radeon_vid swap_fourcc=1

List of driver's parameters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mtrr=1/0                   configures MTRR (if available) default = 1
swap_fourcc=1/0            performs byte swapping of passed fourcc.
			   (It's required for compatibility with -vo mga)
			   
To know more about driver's parameters execute:
modinfo radeon_vid
or
modinfo rage128_vid
			   
Note:
~~~~~
For command line of mplayer: 
You can pass only options with can be recognized by vo_vesa driver.
(Indeed radeon_vid and rage128_vid are stupid things and can create
video overlay only. But mode switching and other adjustement performs
vo_vesa driver. This mean that they use VESA BIOS as graphics server).

Conslusion:
~~~~~~~~~~~
This stuff (radeon(rage128)_vid) currently doesn't support any standards.
So after implementing linux standards I'll fully rewrite this driver.

Full example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
modprobe radeon_vid mtrr=1
echo "deinterlace_pattern=F0055555">>/dev/radeon_vid
mplayer -vo vesa:lvo:/dev/radeon_vid -fs -zoom -bpp 32 filename

Enjoy!
