	framebuffer driver for ATI Radeon chipset video boards
	======================================================

These files are replacement for linux-2.4.x-ac.y drivers.
To use this driver you should have at least linux-2.4.5-ac.1
then simply replace linux/drivers/video/radeon* with files
from this directory.
Note: since linux-2.4.10 this driver was moved from -ac to
Linus distribution.

Alternative way:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Simply type 'make' command in this directory then copy results ( *.o files ) to: 
/lib/modules/$(LINUX_VER)/kernel/drivers/video
directory.
Don't forget about: 
depmod -a

Anyway you should have 'Frame buffer support' compiled into linux-kernel
and at least '8bpp packed pixel support' compiled and installed as module.  
(But if you plan to use this module with mplayer you also should have
16bpp, 24bpp and 32bpp pixel support compiled as modules).  

Enjoy
