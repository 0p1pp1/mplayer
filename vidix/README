VIDIX - Video Interface for *niX.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This library was designed and introduced as interface to userspace drivers
to provide DGA everywhere where it's possible (unline X11).
I hope that these drivers will be portable same as X11 (not only on *nix).

For detail on how to develop new driver see main/DOCS/tech/vidix.txt
